	Title: September playtest now available!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: The first playtest for our next big release is out now!\n\nThe biggest change in this playtest compared to our July release is the overhauled in-game interface. Players will also enjoy the new plane separation behaviour, balancing improvements and updated campaign missions, while a heavily improved Lua API, mission objectives, a prerequisites system and unit upgrades will bring benefits to mappers and modders.\n\nPlease give this playtest a try and report any and all problems you encounter at http://bugs.openra.net.
