	Title: Another week, another playtest!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: We have received a small number of issues after last week's playtest release. These issues have been addressed and so we are releasing a new playtest for you to check out!\n\nThe fixes concern mostly single-player missions, but also included a rare crash that could occur in the Dune 2000 mod, as well as the noticeable rendering glitches with range circles and nuke explosions.\n\nHave a look at http://changelog.openra.net for the full changelog. Don't hesitate to report all problems and issues you encounter at http://bugs.openra.net! Thanks, and enjoy!
