	Title: Another playtest is available!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: We are very grateful that there has been a lot of feedback on our last playtest, which helped us fix a number of issues our testers have encountered.\n\nIn particular, the balancing in the Red Alert mod has received some more touch-ups, a number of crashes have been fixed, and the overly enthusiastic "Enemy approaching" warnings have been disabled for now. For the complete list of changes please see the changelog\n\nNow, please go forth and test! Thank you!
