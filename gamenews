	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: Hot on the heels of last week's, we have released the final playtest in preparation for our next stable release.\n\nThis playtest improves memory usage, corrects a long-standing bug with crushing fences, among others, introduces an overhauled observer and replay sidebar, and sees more work towards the single-player campaigns.  The new Lua API has gained another set of improvements and is finally able to completely replace the old API, which has now been removed.\n\nPlease take this playtest out for a spin and report any and all problems at http://bugs.openra.net.
