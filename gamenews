	Title: Red Alert balancing finished for the next release!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: The Red Alert balancing adjustments have been finished and thus warrant another playtest, which will hopefully be the last before our next long-awaited release.\n\nBesides the RA balancing, which represents the bulk of the changes, some minor fixes and polishing are included. For the detailed list, please see our changelog at http://changelog.openra.net as usual.\n\nThis will likely be your last chance to give feedback and contribute to this release, so please report any problems you encounter at http://bugs.openra.net.\n\nThank you, and have fun!
