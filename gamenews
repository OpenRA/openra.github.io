	Title: Another playtest with lots of fixes!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: Our plan to release the stable version this weekend has unfortunately been thwarted by a few show-stopper bugs. Those have now all been fixed, so a new playtest is available!\n\nIt includes, among others, fixes for the freezes that would sometimes occur mid-game, and also for crashes that happened when joining servers or selecting specific maps in the lobby. Please see the complete changelog at http://changelog.openra.net for all the details.\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, please let us know on our bugtracker at http://bugs.openra.net.\n\nThank you very much!
