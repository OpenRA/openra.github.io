	Author: Paul Chote
	Content: We are releasing a new playtest today that refines and fixes several issues in the current release:\n\n  • Fixed performance issues\n  • Fixed aircraft targeting issues\n  • Fixed crashes during gameplay or loading savegames\n  • Fixed several behaviour issues with unit and bot AI\n  • Fixed missing team chat in game replays\n  • Improved build icon layout in RA and D2k sidebars\n  • Improved in-game menu option layout\n\nWe encourage everybody to try a game or two, and to let us know if we have missed any other issues before a final hotfix release in a couple of weeks time.
