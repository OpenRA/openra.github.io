	Title: New worm-infested playtest out now!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: There is a new release on the horizon for which we have released the first playtest today.\n\nThe focus of improvements has been on the Dune 2000 mod, which most importantly now features Sandworms and Carryalls. The biggest change in the Red Alert mod has been the addition of playable country factions, each with its own special abilities. On top of that, the game has received quite a number of performance improvements as well as the usual bug fixes and polishing all over the place.\n\nPlease give this playtest a try and report any and all problems at http://bugs.openra.net.\nThank you, and happy new year!
