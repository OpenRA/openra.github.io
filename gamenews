	Author: Paul Chote
	Content: We are today pushing a new build that addresses a number of issues discovered in playtest-20190209:\n\n  • Fixed target cursor issues with buildings under the fog\n  • Fixed inconsistent "Unit Ready" audio notifications\n  • Fixed inconsistent harvester behaviour\n  • Fixed turrets "twitching" when aiming at some targets\n  • Fixed a collection of RA map and mission issues\n  • Implemented community-driven RA balance changes\n\nWe expect to repackage this final release candidate as a new release if no further regressions are found.\n\nVisit www.openra.net to download and comment!
