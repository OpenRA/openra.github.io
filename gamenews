	Title: New Playtest incoming! Release imminent!
	Author: Oliver Brakmann
	Content: There is a new playtest out with lots of goodies for you to enjoy!\n\nAgain the focus has been on the Dune 2000 mod, which gained a new sidebar and harvester insurance. Important to many, left-click orders have made a return with this playtest. In addition, there have been the usual number of bug fixes and improvements all over the place.\n\nAs usual, please give this playtest a try and let us know about any bugs and issues you encounter at http://bugs.openra.net.\n\nThank you, and have fun!
