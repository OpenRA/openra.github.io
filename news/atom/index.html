    &lt;p&gt;While we work on the next full playtest (more on this below), there are a few serious issues that we wanted to address without further delay. &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Release 20200202&lt;/a&gt; is now available, including:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for significant performance and behaviour regressions with aircraft&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for rare crashes during gameplay and when loading saved games&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several issues with mission scripts and the skirmish AI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for missing team chat in game replays&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for build failures caused by an &lt;a href="https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/"&gt;upstream API change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improvements to the build icon layout in RA and D2k sidebars&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improvements to the in-game menu option layout&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/44d23a103e9dc3e06c1944bbf9f9f411f865066f"&gt;full Changelog&lt;/a&gt; includes more detail, and we welcome feedback in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Progress is converging on our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestone/29"&gt;Next Release&lt;/a&gt; milestone, and we hope to start playtesting in the near future. Some of the changes to look forward to include improvements to production rally points and unit pathfinding, new features for the map editor, and major improvements to the in-game UI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Members of our Discord and IRC channels already know that the headline features for the next release are the long-awaited abilities to smoothly zoom the battlefield using the mouse wheel and to adjust the size of the in-game UI. These features are built on top of a much larger rework of the game rendering, which includes dropping support for the legacy OpenGL 2 graphics API. If you can’t wait to try these, or would like to help with testing (especially if you use Linux with an AMD graphics card), we encourage you to take a look at &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=21092"&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/release-20191117/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for release-20191117 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in time for the holiday season, OpenRA release-20191117 is now available with all of the features and fixes that have been tested and refined in the playtest builds over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big new features like save-game support, new UI for Tiberian Dawn and spectators, and completely overhauled unit behaviours make this one of our most exciting releases to date!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details, we hand over to FiveAces who has put together a comprehensive video introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20191117"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; release is also available for the modding community to take advantage of the new release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are releasing a new playtest today that refines and fixes several issues in the current release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/c552313bead52fbe4eb2d268e67609ad365205c6"&gt;The full Changelog&lt;/a&gt; includes:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Fixed significant performance and behaviour regressions with aircraft&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed rare crashes during gameplay and when loading saved games&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several behaviour issues with unit and bot AI&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;Improved in-game menu option layout&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20200118"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; release is also available with a number of additional fixes for modders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since we expect this to be the only playtest before a final hotfix release around the start of February, we encourage everybody (especially those who like to play in multiplayer team games) to try a game or two, and to let us know if we have missed any other issues or accidentally introduced new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome feedback in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses several issues discovered in the previous playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/b86b6d003747ce23f955c9ce5ea578cdac993546"&gt;changes in playtest-20191102&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed infantry failing to dodge crushes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed pilots ejected from killed aircraft remaining in the air&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Restored ability to force-move helicopters above enemy buildings&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several long-standing issues with classic (left-click) mouse controls&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed 64-bit installation directory on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are now aiming for a late November stable release, which gives approximately two weeks for any final issues to be discovered with this playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20191021/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20191021 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new playtest is now available for OpenRA’s increasingly poorly named “Summer 2019” release. Thanks to everybody who tested the last playtest, this build should address all the issues and feedback that have been reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key changes in playtest-20191021 from the previous &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190825"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several issues with game loading/saving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several crashes and a desync issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several glitches related to unit movement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several mission related issues in Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several compatibility issues with Linux and FreeBSD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refinements to the new spectator UI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further Red Alert balance adjustments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this will be the last playtest build, and if no further issues are found we expect a new release version in a few weeks time.
Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;, try it out, and let us know if you find any issues or have any other feedback before it is too late!
As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/e9727bc4e669cdbd5d5b3bfa1e26946d2c4708c7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub if you would like to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Season 8 of the Red Alert Global League is well underway. Resident RAGL wrangler netnazgul has been posting weekly wrap-up reports on the forum (&lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21029"&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21031"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt;), covering the highlights and providing links to stream VODs for everybody who would like to keep up with the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-ragl.gif" alt="Explosive RAGL action" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;RAGL Season 8 has been packed with explosive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been relatively quiet about OpenRA’s Tiberian Sun mod lately, but this does not mean it has been abandoned. Development has been focused mainly on resolving low-level game engine issues, which has been slow due to the complexity of the work involved and relative lack of manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this work can be seen in &lt;a href="/news/release-20180923/"&gt;release-20180923&lt;/a&gt; which included renderer changes that roughly doubled TS’s in-game performance, in &lt;a href="/news/release-20190314"&gt;release-20190314&lt;/a&gt; which fixed a collection of game-breaking bugs with Nod’s cloak generator technology, and in the upcoming release which significantly improves deployable units and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployable units were a big part of Tiberian Sun, with several combat units, support units, and even production facilities (in the Firestorm expansion) all having the ability to switch between mobile and stationary modes. OpenRA’s unit-deploy code was originally written for the classic Construction Yards, and was poorly suited for the more dynamic gameplay cases used in Tiberian Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code has been overhauled to add missing features and additional quality of life improvements. Deploy commands can now be queued between other orders (great for managing transports!), and deployed units can be ordered to undeploy and move to another location (including into a transport, or onto a service depot) as a single action. The risk of accidentally packing your Construction Yard with a misclick has been reduced by requiring the force-move hotkey to be held while issuing these orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-tibsun.png" alt="Tiberian Sun update" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft and deployable units work much better in the under-development Tiberian Sun mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code defining aircraft and helicopter movement has also been rewritten, implementing many of the flight dynamics needed for Banshees, Orcas, and Carryalls. The Carryall’s transport behavior has also been refined, with unit pick-up behaving much like the original game, but unit unloading now requiring an explicit order like other transports. This makes it possible to queue multiple transport runs, or to land the Carryall without releasing its cargo. Carryalls can now also be ordered to pick up deployed units, which will undeploy for pickup once the Carryall arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are slowly working through our list of must-have features for a public release, but there are still many more to go. We still cannot predict a release date, but the Tiberian Sun mod is developed in the open on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (like everything else in OpenRA) so everybody is welcome to follow the progress and participate in this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft and deployable units work much better in the under-development Tiberian Sun mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code defining aircraft and helicopter movement has also been rewritten, implementing many of the flight dynamics needed for Banshees, Orcas, and Carryalls. The Carryall’s transport behavior has also been refined, with unit pick-up behaving much like the original game, but unit unloading now requiring an explicit order like other transports. This makes it possible to queue multiple transport runs, or to land the Carryall without releasing its cargo. Carryalls can now also be ordered to pick up deployed units, which will undeploy for pickup once the Carryall arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are slowly working through our list of must-have features for a public release, but there are still many more to go. We still cannot predict a release date, but the Tiberian Sun mod is developed in the open on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (like everything else in OpenRA) so everybody is welcome to follow the progress and participate in this work.&lt;/p&gt;
