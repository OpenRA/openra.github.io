    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20170304/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OpenRA had a very successful 2016: including two feature-packed releases, a &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19525"&gt;map design contest&lt;/a&gt; that produced many great maps, and two seasons of the &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=19750"&gt;RA Global League&lt;/a&gt; which separated the wheat from the chaff across a grueling 544 battles.  Our online player numbers have nearly doubled since this time last year, and it’s now common to see more than 100 commanders &lt;a href="/players/"&gt;on the battlefield&lt;/a&gt; at peak times each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aim to continue this trend through 2017, starting with a new playtest available today.  The playtest includes a collection of balance and map changes for our official mods that have been (often vigourously!) discussed and debated on our &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80"&gt;community forums&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/"&gt;Github issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, plus several notable new features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HiDPI font rendering for players with high resolution displays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several multiplayer bugs that could stall or crash games when a player disconnects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Red Alert “shell map” background is now muted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New behaviour for the Red Alert Gap Generator and Tiberian Dawn Obelisk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for asset installation on 32 bit operating systems and from the original RA95 CDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dune 2000 mod in particular has many changes to make it better match the gameplay and graphical polish of the original game, plus 7 new campaign missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/94da97fde0b142df1b5009c87e53c4006721ab7e"&gt;the full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for more details, and head over to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to try it for yourself!  Your feedback on these playtests is important, because they are the last chance to catch any serious bugs or undo any controversial balance changes before they are included in an official release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170304-gapgen.png" alt="High resolution font rendering" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Red Alert Gap Generators now actively reduce enemy unit sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170304-hidpi.png" alt="High resolution font rendering" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Players with high resolution laptop or 4k displays will appreciate crisper font rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest changes in this playtest are behind the scenes; technical improvements that are not visible to players, but important for our development and modding community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Trait-Conditions"&gt;trait conditions&lt;/a&gt; system provides much better control over trait interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actor vision has been overhauled, adding support for features like the RA active gap generators, D2K actors revealing themselves when attacking, and cliffs blocking vision in heightmap-enabled mods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplified weapon definitions using inherited yaml templates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some initial steps towards removing code patterns that are not compatible with save game support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenRA grew out of the C&amp;amp;C modding community, and one of our major goals is to provide a flexible game engine that the community can use for their own projects.  Unfortunately, this goal has been hurt by OpenRA’s single-engine approach, meaning that every new release would unavoidably break community mods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many discussions, we have developed a new mod support strategy that we will implement over the next two OpenRA releases.  This playtest (and the subsequent final release) starts by adding support for parallel OpenRA installs, and we have started developing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModTemplate"&gt;mod template&lt;/a&gt; that includes instructions and scripts to simplify mod development and packaging.  Mods built using this template will be self contained games that function independently from our official mod installs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-game multiplayer server list will now list games for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the mods that a player has installed (even across multiple installations), and will allow players to directly switch to another mod when joining one.  This applies across versions as well as mods, meaning that future OpenRA releases will be able to coexist, and switching between release and playtest servers will be just as easy as switching between RA and TD servers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170304-mpmodswitch.png" alt="New MP server list switcher" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The multiplayer server list is now smarter about multiple OpenRA installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release after next (aiming for mid/late 2017) will complete the mod-support transition by removing the in-game mod chooser and support for manually installed mod packages: all mods (both official and community) will be listed individually with their own names and icons in your Start Menu / Dock / Launcher.  This overlaps with our previously announced plan for a new project logo, and so we are delaying that change to this future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Sun mod has made exciting progress over the last four months, with support being merged for bridges, tunnels, subterranean units, jumpjets, and bouncy grenades.  Improvements to our terrain heightmap logic means that cliffs are finally able to block unit sight and projectiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170304-tibsun.png" alt="Tiberian Sun mod update" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Progress continues on the Tiberian Sun mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of our “core feature TODO” list for Tiberian Sun is now in sight, but there’s still a fair amount of work to do before we can consider a public release.  We expect to have more updates on this progress later in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">OpenRA: A statistic</title>
    <published>2017-01-10T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2017-01-10T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/2017-01-stats-post/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The current release has been out for almost three months now. Time to take a look at some statistics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time when this post was drafted, there have been a recorded 53953 downloads of the latest release from the official OpenRA homepage. Not unsurprisingly, most downloaded packages are for the Windows platform (almost 75%!), with Linux being a distant second at 13% and OS X coming last with the remaining 12%. It is notable that the shares of both Linux and OS X are much larger than their respective share of the desktop market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When launching OpenRA for the first time, players get greeted by a question whether to send system information back to the OpenRA project — the very data which is used to compile these statistics! Of these more than 50k downloads, almost 22,000 individuals (thanks to every one of you!) opted in to this data gathering, which comes out to about 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-downloads-vs-users.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;While we know that many use third-party sources such as &lt;a href="http://playdeb.net/game/OpenRA"&gt;PlayDeb&lt;/a&gt; for their downloads,&lt;br /&gt; the download count from our official site is the only hard number we can rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-enable-sysinfo-checkbox.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you like this post and happen to have OpenRA configured so that is doesn’t send system information,&lt;br /&gt; you can easily re-enable it in the “Advanced” tab of the settings dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the game is allowed to send system information, the time of the last update is recorded in our database. Thanks to this, we know that about 5,000 users have played OpenRA in the first week of 2017. This also allows us to see how “loyal” players are to OpenRA in general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-last-launches.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is an unfathomable idea, but it sure looks like there are users who don’t play OpenRA every day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also get a general idea of the composition of our player base by looking at the language settings that get sent back to us. As expected, the vast majority of players use English (~57%) as their primary language, followed by German-speaking people (16%), which combined make up almost three-fourth of all our users. Surprisingly, the relatively small Netherlands come in at third place with 4.5% of the total. Also noteworthy is a quiet Chinese minority of ~2% at seventh place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-languages.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no big secret that Red Alert is the most popular mod, but just by how much? Here’s the answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-mod-popularity.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Since system information is also sent by people who are not playing online matches, the obvious conclusion here is that Tiberian Dawn and Dune 2000 players are much more invested in single-player and/or skirmish games against the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting way to look at this data is to find out which mods are popular in which countries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-mod-popularity-per-language.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dune 2000 has a relatively larger following in Russia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Italy,&lt;br /&gt; while the Scandinavian countries are deep in the Red Alert camp.&lt;br /&gt; Tiberian Dawn is stronger in Hungary and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenRA master server also records the maps on which online matches are played. The top ten most popular ones are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-top-ten-mp-maps.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the complete list of the top 40 (well, top 38) maps, all those with more than 250 plays. Red Alert’s dominance is again felt here, as every single one of those maps belongs to that mod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-most-popular-maps.png" height="300" width="600" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I find immense joy in the fact that two of the three multiplayer cooperative missions&lt;br /&gt; that have been added in the last release found a spot in the top 40!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To round off this post, let’s look at the length of OpenRA online matches. The average length is 24 minutes and 18 seconds. There is a little bit of variation between mods, as can be seen in the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170110-stats-avg-match-length.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The faster-paced Tiberian Dawn with its shallow tech tree has shorter matches on average,&lt;br /&gt; while the slower gameplay and sprawling tech tree of Dune 2000 lead to longer games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there are a surprising number of very long matches in our databases. A total of 124 matches lasted longer than three hours, and 29 of those even longer than six hours. The longest game — by a wide margin, I might add — that was recorded on our servers was a match amongst four players (and one spectator) on the Red Alert map Doubles that lasted one day and eight hours. Yes, you read that correctly, a 32-hour match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated, guys!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">New OpenRA Logo</title>
    <published>2016-12-23T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-12-23T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/new-project-logo/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we’re pleased to show off the results of a long-overdue project: a new logo for OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161223-new-logo.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logo will be used to represent the OpenRA project as a whole, with the Soviet star logo being kept for the Red Alert mod.
If community feedback is positive then we plan to roll this out with the next OpenRA release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="why-do-we-need-a-new-logo"&gt;Why do we need a new logo?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same logo for OpenRA (the project) and the Red Alert mod causes a lot of confusion, both for new players who may not know that OpenRA contains multiple separate games and for community-run events that need separate logos to distinguish between OpenRA as a whole and the three main mods.  These problems will only get worse in the future when the Tiberian Sun mod is eventually released.  Another issue is that the Soviet star symbol has strong symbolism associated with it, making difficult for us to use it in contexts where people may not be familiar with OpenRA or Red Alert in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="but-why-this-design"&gt;But why this design?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started the design process with three key requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reflect OpenRA’s identity as a modern RTS game that leverages classic gameplay and artwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not tied to a specific game or universe (so no mammoth tanks, tiberium, or faction logos).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be recreated in a SVG vector format for the website and other media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brainstorming session in our IRC channel there was one stand-out winner, which was prototyped and refined to produce the design we are showing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-does-it-look"&gt;How does it look?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have developed mockups of how the logo will look in different contexts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center; margin: 0 -60px"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161223-new-logo-modchooser.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A preview of the ingame mod chooser with the new project logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161223-new-logo-launchers.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
OpenRA icons in your operating system of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161223-new-logo-facebook.png" alt="" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new project logo on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

CONFIRMATION CODE 2169.

TRANSMISSION ENDS.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A release-20161019 hotfix is now available with fixes for two critical multi-player bugs that were missed during the playtesting phase. The original announcement for release-20161015 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to announce the latest stable release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this cycle has seen relatively little changes to the core game code with just about 28,000 changed lines, the new features and fixes it yields make up for it by being very visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place you will notice this is the much improved game content installer. It is now able to copy and install game assets from many more installation sources, such as the original release CDs, the First Decade DVDs, installed copies of the Dune 2000 Gruntsmod edition and even the C&amp;amp;C Ultimate Edition from Origin. Additionally, for the first time ever, the content installer will now also automatically install the campaign briefing videos, which means you no longer have to do that manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-ra-contentinstaller.png" alt="Game content installer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This features comes with one minor down-side: since the new assets are installed into a different place than in previous versions of OpenRA, every player is required to install the game assets again when launching this new version for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, our quest to complete porting the original campaign missions to OpenRA is ongoing. This time around, there are seven new missions for Tiberian Dawn, and one each for Red Alert and Dune 2000. For Red Alert, there are also three new missions which can be played in both single- and cooperative multiplayer mode and which long-time players may find to be vaguely familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other new features and fixes include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a lot of crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a number of bugs that impacted game servers, such as the infamous “grey ping bug”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New configuration options for customizing mouse scrolling behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for navigating to map edges, and bookmarking positions on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for controlling the music player, as well as producing five units at once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved aircraft reloading behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more changes than we are able to mention here, including the usual round of balance changes. Head on over to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/0ae64ef1b6dded0a55900ab67561c2d56885c461"&gt;Changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt; to see the complete list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-d2k-scorescreen.png" alt="Score Screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead of kills and losses the score screen now shows an actual score comprised of the amount of kills as well as other gameplay actions such as capturing and infiltrating buildings, repairing an allies’ units and buildings, and sending them supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-td-burningtrees.png" alt="Burning trees" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Burning trees now provide nice visual effects for flame throwers and nukes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find installers for all supported operating systems on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;. On that topic, OpenRA now requires .NET 4.5 (Windows) / Mono 3.2 or greater (OS X and Linux). Players using Ubuntu 12.04 or other Linux distributions that include Mono 2.10 can upgrade to a supported version by following the instructions on the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives"&gt;Mono site&lt;/a&gt;. Windows XP users will need to upgrade to a supported OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you will enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

For Red Alert, there are also three new missions which can be played in both single- and cooperative multiplayer mode and which long-time players may find to be vaguely familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other new features and fixes include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a lot of crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a number of bugs that impacted game servers, such as the infamous “grey ping bug”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New configuration options for customizing mouse scrolling behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for navigating to map edges, and bookmarking positions on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for controlling the music player, as well as producing five units at once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved aircraft reloading behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more changes than we are able to mention here, including the usual round of balance changes. Head on over to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/561383b9ba791a557cde37616f42a8df7d8a3182"&gt;Changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt; to see the complete list.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-d2k-scorescreen.png" alt="Score Screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead of kills and losses the score screen now shows an actual score comprised of the amount of kills as well as other gameplay actions such as capturing and infiltrating buildings, repairing an allies’ units and buildings, and sending them supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-td-burningtrees.png" alt="Burning trees" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Burning trees now provide nice visual effects for flame throwers and nukes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find installers for all supported operating systems on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;. On that topic, OpenRA now requires .NET 4.5 (Windows) / Mono 3.2 or greater (OS X and Linux). Players using Ubuntu 12.04 or other Linux distributions that include Mono 2.10 can upgrade to a supported version by following the instructions on the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives"&gt;Mono site&lt;/a&gt;. Windows XP users will need to upgrade to a supported OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you will enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
