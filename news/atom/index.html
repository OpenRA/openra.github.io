    &lt;p&gt;We are releasing a new playtest today that refines and fixes several issues in the current release.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/c552313bead52fbe4eb2d268e67609ad365205c6"&gt;The full Changelog&lt;/a&gt; includes:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed significant performance and behaviour regressions with aircraft&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed rare crashes during gameplay and when loading saved games&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several behaviour issues with unit and bot AI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed missing team chat in game replays&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed build failures caused by an &lt;a href="https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/"&gt;upstream API change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improved build icon layout in RA and D2k sidebars&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Improved in-game menu option layout&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20200118"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; release is also available with a number of additional fixes for modders.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since we expect this to be the only playtest before a final hotfix release around the start of February, we encourage everybody (especially those who like to play in multiplayer team games) to try a game or two, and to let us know if we have missed any other issues or accidentally introduced new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As always, we welcome feedback in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/release-20191117/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for release-20191117 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in time for the holiday season, OpenRA release-20191117 is now available with all of the features and fixes that have been tested and refined in the playtest builds over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big new features like save-game support, new UI for Tiberian Dawn and spectators, and completely overhauled unit behaviours make this one of our most exciting releases to date!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more details, we hand over to FiveAces who has put together a comprehensive video introduction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like videos, the main changes have been outlined in previous news posts [&lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/preview-20190606/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190825/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20191021/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;], and, as always, in the  &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/501a7ebe7d9bc8e02161db135272fc49439e17e6"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;. A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20191117"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; release is also available for the modding community to take advantage of the new release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses several issues discovered in the previous playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/b86b6d003747ce23f955c9ce5ea578cdac993546"&gt;changes in playtest-20191102&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed infantry failing to dodge crushes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed pilots ejected from killed aircraft remaining in the air&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Restored ability to force-move helicopters above enemy buildings&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several long-standing issues with classic (left-click) mouse controls&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed 64-bit installation directory on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are now aiming for a late November stable release, which gives approximately two weeks for any final issues to be discovered with this playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20191021/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20191021 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new playtest is now available for OpenRA’s increasingly poorly named “Summer 2019” release. Thanks to everybody who tested the last playtest, this build should address all the issues and feedback that have been reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key changes in playtest-20191021 from the previous &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190825"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several issues with game loading/saving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several crashes and a desync issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several glitches related to unit movement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several mission related issues in Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several compatibility issues with Linux and FreeBSD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refinements to the new spectator UI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further Red Alert balance adjustments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this will be the last playtest build, and if no further issues are found we expect a new release version in a few weeks time.
Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;, try it out, and let us know if you find any issues or have any other feedback before it is too late!
As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/e9727bc4e669cdbd5d5b3bfa1e26946d2c4708c7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub if you would like to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Season 8 of the Red Alert Global League is well underway. Resident RAGL wrangler netnazgul has been posting weekly wrap-up reports on the forum (&lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21029"&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21031"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt;), covering the highlights and providing links to stream VODs for everybody who would like to keep up with the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-ragl.gif" alt="Explosive RAGL action" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;RAGL Season 8 has been packed with explosive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been relatively quiet about OpenRA’s Tiberian Sun mod lately, but this does not mean it has been abandoned. Development has been focused mainly on resolving low-level game engine issues, which has been slow due to the complexity of the work involved and relative lack of manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this work can be seen in &lt;a href="/news/release-20180923/"&gt;release-20180923&lt;/a&gt; which included renderer changes that roughly doubled TS’s in-game performance, in &lt;a href="/news/release-20190314"&gt;release-20190314&lt;/a&gt; which fixed a collection of game-breaking bugs with Nod’s cloak generator technology, and in the upcoming release which significantly improves deployable units and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployable units were a big part of Tiberian Sun, with several combat units, support units, and even production facilities (in the Firestorm expansion) all having the ability to switch between mobile and stationary modes. OpenRA’s unit-deploy code was originally written for the classic Construction Yards, and was poorly suited for the more dynamic gameplay cases used in Tiberian Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code has been overhauled to add missing features and additional quality of life improvements. Deploy commands can now be queued between other orders (great for managing transports!), and deployed units can be ordered to undeploy and move to another location (including into a transport, or onto a service depot) as a single action. The risk of accidentally packing your Construction Yard with a misclick has been reduced by requiring the force-move hotkey to be held while issuing these orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-tibsun.png" alt="Tiberian Sun update" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft and deployable units work much better in the under-development Tiberian Sun mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code defining aircraft and helicopter movement has also been rewritten, implementing many of the flight dynamics needed for Banshees, Orcas, and Carryalls. The Carryall’s transport behavior has also been refined, with unit pick-up behaving much like the original game, but unit unloading now requiring an explicit order like other transports. This makes it possible to queue multiple transport runs, or to land the Carryall without releasing its cargo. Carryalls can now also be ordered to pick up deployed units, which will undeploy for pickup once the Carryall arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are slowly working through our list of must-have features for a public release, but there are still many more to go. We still cannot predict a release date, but the Tiberian Sun mod is developed in the open on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (like everything else in OpenRA) so everybody is welcome to follow the progress and participate in this work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2019-08-25T12:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-08-25T12:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190825/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled and relieved to finally announce the first public playtest for OpenRA’s second 2019 release. This playtest brings significant technical changes, so we felt it important to delay the “summer” release until we could be confident that the worst bugs and gameplay regressions had been fixed. With some help from our &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; community, we are now ready to release &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; for wider testing and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/preview-20190606/"&gt;Summer Release Preview&lt;/a&gt; article outlined several of the new UI features, including &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;savegame support&lt;/span&gt;, a new &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;spectator UI&lt;/span&gt;, and a long planned &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;Tiberian Dawn interface overhaul&lt;/span&gt;. This playtest adds a much improved &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;hotkey configuration UI&lt;/span&gt; and many smaller UI fixes and polish improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Dawn in-game interface has received a long-awaited redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Missions and skirmish games can be saved and restarted later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the gameplay front, the main focus for this release was to rewrite the logic that controls how units behave and respond to orders. This was a major task that spanned several months, more than 90 Pull Requests, and more than one debate about bug vs “accidental feature”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the changes will not be immediately obvious, but on closer inspection you should find that many long-standing quirks and annoyances in unit behaviour no longer occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to queue commands using the Shift key has always been an important part of OpenRA’s gameplay, and this has received a major overhaul with this release. Part of the overhaul has moved the familiar targeting lines that display when you command units into the “Waypoint Mode” (Shift) overlay by default. The previous behaviour can be restored through the Settings menu (Target Lines: Automatic) if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190825-waypoint.png" alt="Waypoint mode." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The improved waypoint mode allows you to plan your attack strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other noteable changes to watch out for include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force Move (Alt) can be used to undeploy Construction Yards and land helicopters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft respond to Scatter orders from the Command Bar (Ctrl + X)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significantly improved behaviour for harvesters, aircraft, attack-move, and unit repair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given an attack direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The controversial Allied Hind helicopter in RA has been replaced with the Black Hawk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two new-to-OpenRA missions from the RA Counterstrike expansion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The D2k Death Hand missile now works like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Red Alert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#td-balance-changes"&gt;Tiberian Dawn&lt;/a&gt; balance changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available with more information on the changes and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given a direction by dragging the mouse while targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a .NET application, OpenRA relies on the Mono runtime for our Linux and macOS players. Unfortunately, the Mono packages provided by some major LTS distros are several years out of date and incompatible with the modern .NET standard. Worse, the new Debian Buster and Ubuntu 19.04 releases shipped with a serious Mono bug that causes unavoidable crashes OpenRA and other .NET applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution for these issues is to package the parts of Mono that OpenRA requires inside the AppImage and macOS app releases. This means that you can finally play OpenRA without having to install any system-level dependencies. For players or packagers who prefer to compile OpenRA from source, Mono 5.4 or later and msbuild are now required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating our base requirements has allowed several further improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows releases are now 64 bit by default (32 bit releases remain available)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fix for the macOS black-screen startup freeze after Mono or macOS upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Future support for the .NET Core runtime (this work is still in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved development tooling and IDE support for OpenRA and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtest releases do not overwrite the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server. Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try! This is your time to get involved, play games, and let us know what you think!
