&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time for yet another OpenRA tournament which, for the first time ever, will feature a prize pool of $200!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again our community member Ripley calls to all OpenRA players to compete for the crown of ultimate RTS champions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running on the weekends of March 5th-6th and March 11th-12th 2016, the tourney will take the format of tag team elimination. Teams of two players will square off in a total of three games, two of which being 1v1 matches between pairs of opposing players and a final 2v2 match between both teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the casters of the Comcast Crew and &lt;a href="http://www.gamereplays.org/portals.php"&gt;GameReplays.org&lt;/a&gt; a prize pool of $200 will be rewarded! The prize will be split 80/20 between the first and second place, to be evenly shared among team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For official tournament rules and team registration, &lt;a href="http://forum.openra.net/82/19414"&gt;visit the forum thread&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for a team mate, have a look at &lt;a href="http://forum.openra.net/82/19415"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;. Registration ends on March 2nd at 0:00 UTC, so don’t waste any time and register right now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the event will be covered by a number of casters. Channels and streams will be announced once the tournament starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish all participants good luck and a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The OpenRA development team wishes you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/PastDelightfulIberianbarbel" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="600" height="300" style="-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;-webkit-transform: scale(1);"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce the Christmas 2015 release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding:10px; margin:10px;"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;
I've got a present for ya!
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; Commando
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 developer elves have toiled long and hard to fill your stocking with lots of fixes, improvements and long-awaited features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, this release introduces the global chat channel that is shared across all mods, which will allow you to meet up with other waiting players and arrange matches without joining servers. Going along with it is a re-design of the ingame server browser as well as the skirmish lobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-multiplayer.png" alt="Global chat lobby" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The channel is available from outside the game as well,&lt;br /&gt;by connecting to irc.openra.net:6667 channel #lobby using your favourite IRC client.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new in this release is a game speed selector, a feature that many people have often and repeatedly asked for over the years, and now it’s finally here, for multiplayer, single-player skirmish and missions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, OpenRA now offers an additional way of scrolling the map similar to the way it worked in the original Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 (by right-clicking and moving the mouse). To use it, select the “Joystick” scrolling option in the input settings dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A change we are sure many will rejoice to hear is that units will now start with the “Defend” stance by default. No more losing units that decided to hunt after enemies without your explicit orders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big focus of this release has been overhauling our Dune 2000 mod.  We have added Thumpers, spice blows, and rebalanced all unit and 
building statistics to more closely match the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-d2k.png" alt="Dune 2000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Alert mod has received some much-needed balance changes, with a focus on making the country-specific units more interesting and useful. The changes are too numerous to list them all here, have a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/9d09bd438465884fdeb11de66931a65d5fe5d6cc"&gt;the changelog&lt;/a&gt; for all the details. There are also a total of five new missions for the Soviet single-player campaign, which means that it is the first of our campaigns to be 50% complete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Dawn mod also includes two new single-player missions, as well as some minor balance changes and several new multi-player maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, we not only have treats for our players, but for modders as well. The map editor has seen further improvements, such as a cash counter and a copy and paste function. There are also new traits for weather and lighting effects, more flexible &lt;code&gt;Missile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DeployToUpgrade&lt;/code&gt; logic, as well as new additions to the Lua API. As usual, use the OpenRA.Utility to upgrade your mods or maps to this new release. Be warned, however, that there are couple of changes this time around where it unfortunately wasn’t possible to offer an automated upgrade path. Most of these are mentioned in the changelog, the OpenRA.Utility will alert you to the remaining ones when it runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more minor changes and bugfixes, so take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/9d09bd438465884fdeb11de66931a65d5fe5d6cc"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to unwrap all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">December Release Candidate 3</title>
    <published>2015-12-13T19:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-12-13T19:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20151213/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are slowly making progress towards fixing all the crashes and issues our testers (you!) have found, and the final release is imminent. Thanks to everyone who took the time to play the previous playtests and report bugs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have fixed all but one of the remaining issues, so it’s time for another playtest. In particular, it contains the following fixes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A GPS-related crash has been fixed (reported by Zypres and abdcdefg30, thanks to both!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A crash that occured when producing an actor without any IOccupySpace traits in conjunction with UpgradeActorsNear has been fixed (reported by GraionDilach, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware cursors will not be permanently disabled when their creation fails (reported by pi99y, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using both mouse buttons at once when attack-moving will produce the expected results again (first reported by Aaron Lloyd, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In addition, rubberband selection will be possible again in Attack-Move mode (reported by ozzyyzzo, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A crash that could occur in the Dune 2000 mod when placing concrete outside of the map bounds was fixed (reported by kiores, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A minor issue with AI unit behaviour in Red Alert’s Survival02 mission has been addressed (reported by r34ch, thanks!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one remaining issue is a performance regression, the cause of which is as of now still eluding us. While it’s hardly noticeable unless you make a direct comparison, it would still be nice to fix that for the upcoming release, however we will probably not delay it indefinitely. So the next release may or may not include that performance regression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, please give this (hopefully last!) playtest a good workout. You can download it, as always, from our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;. The feature list is quite impressive and makes playing it very worth your time. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/5157ea6cce42eb43071eb759b09432f87e694c75"&gt;changelog page&lt;/a&gt; to see all the details. Also be sure to report any and all problems you find at our &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; or in our &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you very much!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">December Release Candidate 2</title>
    <published>2015-11-29T15:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-11-29T15:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20151129/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received a lot of feedback on our last two playtests, and we tried to address as many of the reported issues as possible.  Thanks to everyone who has tried the playtests and reported bugs or other feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fixed some new, as well as some long-standing issues for this playtest, so hopefully this will be the final release candidate for the upcoming December release.  We encourage you to give this release a good try out, especially if you like to play competitively online, because if we don’t hear your balance complaints now then you will be stuck with them for the next few months until our next release!  You can report any issues you have by &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;filing a bug&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;joining our IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus for this playtest was on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing bugs with target acquisition with GPS and Gap Generators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing issues with some Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert missions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Polishing the Dune 2000 thumpers, spiceblooms, Saboteurs and production structure decorations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing some crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we responded to the following issues reported during the last playtest:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash in the GDI06 mission. (thanks, @Snurre86)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash when refreshing the multiplayer server list. (thanks, @pi99y)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash when spawning resources outside the map borders. (thanks, @Frount)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an unintentional buff to missiles across all mods. (thanks, @Spy)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restored targeting cursor when hovering over disguised enemy spies. (thanks, @kyrylo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, you can find the full details about the changes on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/36203a1fdc608d380964485bac9d8671a5658983"&gt;changelog page&lt;/a&gt; and the installer for your operating system on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151129-d2k-production-decorations.png" alt="Editor copy/paste" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In D2k production structures now have a proper “Primary” sign for primary structures,
and use the green star to show that they are upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151129-editor-actor-remap.png" alt="Editor copy/paste" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A bit more polish for the Map Editor - the player color remap on actors such as Cameras and Spawn points was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <published>2015-11-14T19:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-11-14T19:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20151114/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We received some great feedback on our &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20151031/"&gt;Halloween playtest&lt;/a&gt;, and have been hard at work over the last two weeks fixing the issues that have been reported.  Thanks to everyone who has tried the playtest and reported bugs or other feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now happy enough with the stability and integration of &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20151031/"&gt;all the new
features&lt;/a&gt; to mark today’s new playtest build as the first release candidate for our upcoming December release.  We encourage you to give this release a good try out, especially if you like to play competitively online, because if we don’t hear your balance complaints now then you will be stuck with them for the next few months until our next release!  You can report any issues you have by &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;filing a bug&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;joining our IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release fixes several general issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a hang when exiting the game under Windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed an exploit that allowed the color validator to be bypassed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed Battlefield News never updating for some players&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved polish and integration of the global chat channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixes for the Dune 2000 mod include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed repair depots not repairing units, and buffed repair rate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed missing unit crates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed incorrect unit armor / damage statistics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved behaviour of Spice Blooms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved behaviour of Thumpers and Worms&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tweaked support power timers and Ornithoper Strike damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We further iterated the Red Alert mod balance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed units not targeting enemy units under the fog when GPS is available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduced Spy Power Plant infiltration power-outage time to 20 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved the speed, sight, and passenger count of England’s Phase Tank&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved the cooldown between jumps for Germany’s Chrono Tank&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved Russia’s Tesla Tank by allowing them to attack while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed M.A.D. Tanks destroying trees&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed several issues in the single player missions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Dawn mod received some fixes too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed Visceroids spawning when infantry are crushed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed issues with the C&amp;amp;C64 - GDI01 and Nod05 missions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved the Nod delivery plane landing animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, you can find the installer for your operating system on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151114-copypaste.png" alt="Editor copy/paste" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Surprise bonus feature! Copy/paste is now available in the map editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second Big Team Tournament concluded yesterday, and was a huge success.  Two teams of 11 players battled over the last week to a 30—30 tie.  The tie was resolved with a final battle between the two team captains, which ended with a decisive victory for Team Kyrylo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replays for all 61 tournament matches are available &lt;a href="http://64hdb.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_replays/BTT2015/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://64hdb.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_replays/BTT2015/%5BBTT2015%5D-GAME-LIST.txt"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt;), and the first batch of archived live-streams can be found on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzj3L8LKCBN7I-lS0LqMHDQ"&gt;hamb’s YouTube page&lt;/a&gt;.  Games from FiveAces’ and SoScared’s streams will be exported and uploaded in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of our players, our fantastic live streamers &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CovertFlobert"&gt;FiveAces&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.twitch.tv/soscared"&gt;SoScared&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzj3L8LKCBN7I-lS0LqMHDQ"&gt;Hamb&lt;/a&gt;, and to everyone who watched the streams and participated in the live chats on Mumble and IRC!&lt;/p&gt;
