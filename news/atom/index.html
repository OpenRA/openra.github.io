    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190825/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled and relieved to finally announce the first public playtest for OpenRA’s second 2019 release. This playtest brings significant technical changes, so we felt it important to delay the “summer” release until we could be confident that the worst bugs and gameplay regressions had been fixed. With some help from our &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; community, we are now ready to release &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; for wider testing and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/preview-20190606/"&gt;Summer Release Preview&lt;/a&gt; article outlined several of the new UI features, including &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;savegame support&lt;/span&gt;, a new &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;spectator UI&lt;/span&gt;, and a long planned &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;Tiberian Dawn interface overhaul&lt;/span&gt;. This playtest adds a much improved &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;hotkey configuration UI&lt;/span&gt; and many smaller UI fixes and polish improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Dawn in-game interface has received a long-awaited redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Missions and skirmish games can be saved and restarted later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the gameplay front, the main focus for this release was to rewrite the logic that controls how units behave and respond to orders. This was a major task that spanned several months, more than 90 Pull Requests, and more than one debate about bug vs “accidental feature”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the changes will not be immediately obvious, but on closer inspection you should find that many long-standing quirks and annoyances in unit behaviour no longer occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to queue commands using the Shift key has always been an important part of OpenRA’s gameplay, and this has received a major overhaul with this release. Part of the overhaul has moved the familiar targeting lines that display when you command units into the “Waypoint Mode” (Shift) overlay by default. The previous behaviour can be restored through the Settings menu (Target Lines: Automatic) if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190825-waypoint.png" alt="Waypoint mode." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The improved waypoint mode allows you to plan your attack strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other noteable changes to watch out for include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force Move (Alt) can be used to undeploy Construction Yards and land helicopters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft respond to Scatter orders from the Command Bar (Ctrl + X)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significantly improved behaviour for harvesters, aircraft, attack-move, and unit repair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given an attack direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The controversial Allied Hind helicopter in RA has been replaced with the Black Hawk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two new-to-OpenRA missions from the RA Counterstrike expansion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The D2k Death Hand missile now works like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Red Alert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#td-balance-changes"&gt;Tiberian Dawn&lt;/a&gt; balance changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available with more information on the changes and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-directional-powers.gif" alt="Directional powers." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given a direction by dragging the mouse while targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a .NET application, OpenRA relies on the Mono runtime for our Linux and macOS players. Unfortunately, the Mono packages provided by some major LTS distros are several years out of date and incompatible with the modern .NET standard. Worse, the new Debian Buster and Ubuntu 19.04 releases shipped with a serious Mono bug that causes unavoidable crashes OpenRA and other .NET applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution for these issues is to package the parts of Mono that OpenRA requires inside the AppImage and macOS app releases. This means that you can finally play OpenRA without having to install any system-level dependencies. For players or packagers who prefer to compile OpenRA from source, Mono 5.4 or later and msbuild are now required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating our base requirements has allowed several further improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows releases are now 64 bit by default (32 bit releases remain available)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fix for the macOS black-screen startup freeze after Mono or macOS upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Future support for the .NET Core runtime (this work is still in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved development tooling and IDE support for OpenRA and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtest releases do not overwrite the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server. Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try! This is your time to get involved, play games, and let us know what you think! If you discover a bug or have any other feedback, please let us know in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Upcoming features for the summer release</title>
    <published>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/preview-20190606/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been quite a while since our last release, but not to worry, we are still going - mostly rewriting tons of code not visible to the outside eye. While not presenting a full playtest we want to take the time to introduce the community to some upcoming changes to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="singleplayer-savegames"&gt;Singleplayer savegames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most wanted missing feature, the next version will include support for savegames in both skirmish and the campaigns. No more losing all progress to a stray dog eating your Tanya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Longer missions can now be played in several takes instead of needing you to pull through in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spectator-ui-and-new-tiberian-dawn-sidebar"&gt;Spectator UI and new Tiberian Dawn sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spectator UI has always been noted to be clunky and take too much space on the screen. With the next update we are happy to finally introduce a more slim and focused spectator UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-spectator-UI.png" alt="A new spectator UI." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new transparent overlay is a huge quality of live upgrade for both casters and casual spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second most visible update features yet another long standing UI rework that was just completed last month after sitting on the shelf for years. The sidebar in Tiberian Dawn was completely overhauled and looks better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-building-placement-previews"&gt;Polished building placement previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much to say here, the images will tell the story. The tweaked placement preview in RA, TD, and D2k makes it easier to see both the building being placed and any cells that are blocked by units or debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side node for the modders reading this: With the coming update the core engine will also support placing building variants in your mod (if you like north and south facing refineries for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new Tiberian Dawn UI includes a refreshed building placement overlay and brand new sidebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-map-previews"&gt;Polished map previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingame UI was not the only thing getting an upgrade. We overhauled the map previews of the map chooser to look the same as ingame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-map-previews.gif" alt="Overhauled map previews." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new previews include the positions of forests and civilian structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="setting-support-power-directions"&gt;Setting support power directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parabombs and airstrikes have long been a point of both frustration (when taking too long to reach their destination) and joy (when immediately wiping out an army at the map edge). We kept the joy aspect, but removed the frustration! The upcoming release will allow you to conveniently select the approach vector by dragging into a specific direction while placing the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-directional-powers.gif" alt="Directional powers." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Want to avoid air defenses by sending your troopers in from the south? We’ve got your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="even-more-upcoming-changes"&gt;Even more upcoming changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list is long, too long for this post. A few other noteworthy changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new time limit lobby option for multiplayer and skirmish games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many fixes for queued unit orders, aircraft, and harvesters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed Mono requirement on macOS and Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new name and artwork for the long-controversial Allied Hind in Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many new tweaks and traits for modders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even more bug and performance improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a peek at our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog-(bleed)/5ad4377a7ba21abc017d6c0367750d0ea279d4b0"&gt;development changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in the entire list of upcoming changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Release 20190314</title>
    <published>2019-03-14T20:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-03-14T20:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/release-20190314/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Release 20190314&lt;/a&gt;, which brings changes developed between August 2018 and January 2019 and polished with the help of player feedback &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190302/"&gt;playtests&lt;/a&gt; during the last 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting change in this release comes from a complete overhaul of the unit targeting logic, which fixes many long-standing bugs and introduces some important improvements to gameplay fluidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic targeting now properly accounts for the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker has been promoted to thief, who can steal cash from refineries as well as vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, Red Alert now features an additional seven single-player missions, and Tiberian Dawn another two. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alert &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Balance changes&lt;/a&gt; include adjustments to the long-controversial Allied Artillery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the map editor, including a map actor editor, a new Copy/Paste filter, and the ability to select multiple terrain categories in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more minor changes and bugfixes, so take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to unwrap all of the details. Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses a number of issues discovered in playtest-20190209.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes in &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190302&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed target cursor issues with buildings under the fog&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed inconsistent “Unit Ready” audio notifications&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed harvesters moving to empty resource fields when unloading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed turrets “twitching” when targeting enemies at their maximum range&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed a collection of map and mission issues in Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Implemented community-driven &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/263d8e2b66e6292dfd798cbe369a7cc5befe4c1d#ra-balance-changes-20190302"&gt;balance changes&lt;/a&gt; for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We expect this to be our final release candidate, which will be repackaged as a new release before the end of March if no further regressions are found.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20180209 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;new playtest build&lt;/a&gt; is now available with a collection of fixes and improvements over &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last playtest made some big changes to how targeting interacts with the Fog of War, which broke a lot more than we expected. Rather than reverting these changes, we decided to go all-in, and replaced even more of the targeting code - a job that we had originally planned for the release after next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new changes should fix not just the regressions in the last playtest, but also several other long-standing gameplay bugs and inconsistencies with the Fog of War, engineers, and aircraft. They also bring two long-requested features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new features, which should go a long way towards improving combat fluidness and the ability to micromanage your forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio notification changes introduced in the last playtest have been refined and expanded by adding click feedback to the sidebar, reducing the volume of the “cash tick” sounds, and normalizing the volume changes between different music tracks. The build is rounded out with fixes for bugs and crashes that were reported in the first playtest — see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/7b4a50814a012c161e68378f7af533e6c2dfd5f7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt; news post for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to give it a try, and let us know what you think in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new features, which should go a long way towards improving combat fluidness and the ability to micromanage your forces.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio notification changes introduced in the last playtest have been refined and expanded by adding click feedback to the sidebar, reducing the volume of the “cash tick” sounds, and normalizing the volume changes between different music tracks. The build is rounded out with fixes for bugs and crashes that were reported in the first playtest — see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/7b4a50814a012c161e68378f7af533e6c2dfd5f7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt; news post for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also back into competitive scene, with Red Alert Global League running its seventh season in March and April. New signups are possible until February 27th; check &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=20868"&gt;the registrations thread&lt;/a&gt; for the relevant information on how you can participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament will build up on the structure changes made in the previous season, but coming engine modifications and improvements are sure to stir things up among the competition. We are also to see whether Barf will be able to break the RAGL tradition and become the first triple champion or this continues further with a new player crowned at the end. As usual, there will be an aim to achieve at any tier, with several spots providing monetary prizes from a publicly collected prize pool.&lt;/p&gt;
