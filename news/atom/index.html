    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Work has been progressing well on our next development cycle, and we are today making a snapshot of this work available in the form of a new playtest release.  &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20150628&lt;/a&gt; focuses on behind-the-scenes improvements, but also includes a collection of new features and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible changes in this playtest include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed the “Enemy unit detected” notification, by popular demand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of TD balance changes based on player feedback. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8303"&gt;#8303&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the repair cursor or order a unit to a repair depot.  In D2K a carryall will pick up the actor. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8056"&gt;#8056&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units built from the starport in D2K now work with the “select units by type” hotkey. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8212"&gt;#8212&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to the player name and color validation. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8137"&gt;#8137&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8380"&gt;#8380&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New missions: Nod06b, Nod06c (TD), Soviet02a, Soviet05 (RA), Atreides01a, Atreides01b (D2K).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of polish fixes for maps, tooltips, and unit artwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the technical front, improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of fixes for issues found using &lt;a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3650"&gt;Coverity Scan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several new lint tests to detect common YAML errors in maps and mods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes towards a more consistent set of rendering traits. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8171/"&gt;#8171&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Significant rework of the shroud code to prepare for TS shroud and scripted map area changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved support for compiling and running OpenRA on BSD operating systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API-(playtest)"&gt;Lua API&lt;/a&gt; for map authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full changelog, please refer to &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog"&gt;the changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new in-game map editor has also received a collection of bug fixes, and the ability to view and edit the area outside the playable map area.  The old map editor (which we inadvertently broke in the last release - sorry!) has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any problems or bugs  (especially anything related to the shroud or any new crashes), then please let us know &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-ra-soviet05-screenshot-showcase.png" alt="Red Alert Soviet05 screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;CTRL&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; to take a screenshot. The hotkey binding is configuarable via Settings - Input.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-carryall-repair.gif" alt="Carryall repair delivery" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Use the repair cursor in D2K to signal a Carryall to transport an actor for repair!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-editor.png" alt="New map editor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new map editor is more stable, and updated maps now show correctly in the map selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-ts-shroud.png" alt="TS Shroud" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A preview of things to come: work is nearly complete on rewriting the shroud logic to support terrain height.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Release 20150614</title>
    <published>2015-06-14T10:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-06-14T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/release-20150614/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce the June 2015 release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, it was our goal to reduce the length of this development cycle, and we succeeded! With about 22500 changed lines in just over 300 commits by a total of 25 developers since the last release, the list of new features is naturally a bit shorter than last time around, but it contains some good ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standout feature of this release is of course the long-awaited in-game map editor. For the first time ever, we are offering a map editing ability for all our mods, on all supported operating systems. You can access the map editor from the “Extras” sub-menu of the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new map editor offers the following benefits and features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully cross-platform, just like the game itself. Finally, a map editor for OS X!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Truly WYSIWYG. It uses the game renderer, so there are no more rendering glitches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for all mods. The legacy editor did not support Dune 2000 properly, and Tiberian Sun not at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the legacy editor, there is not yet full feature parity: the in-game editor is missing cut-and-paste operations, a display of the sum of resources on the map, and also does not show the coordinates of cells. These short-comings will be rectified in future releases. Meanwhile, they remain available in the legacy editor, which is still being shipped with this release. It will, however, be removed in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complementing the new editor is an improved map chooser dialog, which now separates official and custom maps. It also allows deleting one or all of your custom maps. We also took this chance to add the often-requested ability for all players to view the map chooser from the game lobby (but changing the map still remains the prerogative of the host).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new feature with a lot of potential is the added operating system integration of OpenRA. The installers will associate the game with OpenRA replay files and OpenRA server URLs. These will allow websites hosting replay archives to add one-click watching of replays, and creating alternative server browsers. As an example, our own &lt;a href="/games/"&gt;web-based server browser&lt;/a&gt; has been enhanced to offer clickable links to waiting games that will automatically start OpenRA and connect you to the server. You can also create bookmarks to your favourite OpenRA servers on your desktop! These associations are available on all supported operating systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minor additions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dune 2000 mod has gained building upgrades, and now matches the original game’s tech tree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A total of six single-player missions have been added to the Tiberian Dawn mod. Enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “Team health colors” option now provides a better distinction between your own and allied units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support powers can now be activated using configurable hotkeys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “quick placement” mode has been added which will automatically pick up a completed building for placement when the player selects the corresponding production tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from new features, the usual number of bug fixes has found its way into the code. Among them is a fix for a high-profile bug that caused the inability to undeploy construction yards. Several graphical problems, from glitches in the menus to occasionally missing mouse cursors have been resolved as well as issues in our single-player mission scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for all the gory details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;! We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-ra-mapeditor.png" alt="Ingame map editor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new map editor was almost 18 months in the making!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-web-server-browser.png" alt="Web-based server browser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The added operating system integration allows connecting to games from links on websites or bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-cnc-missions.png" alt="New single-player missions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The work on our single-player campaigns &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net/4988"&gt;is progressing nicely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The Nod campaign is now almost half done!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-d2k-building-upgrades.png" alt="D2k building upgrades" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Building upgrades have been added to our Dune 2000 mod,&lt;br /&gt;which now allow us to almost match the original game’s tech tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    <published>2015-05-31T10:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-05-31T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20150531/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have received a small number of issues after last week’s playtest release. These issues have been addressed and so we are releasing a new playtest for you to check out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of fixes is agreeably short, which is to be expected after this equally short development cycle. The fixed issues include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A number of issues pertaining to single-player missions in both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A crash in Dune 2000 that happened when a Deviator hit a harvester being picked up by a Carryall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rendering glitches which resulted in highly saturated range circles and blocky nuke explosion effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full changelog, please refer to &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;the changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installers for a number of supported operating systems can be found on &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;the download page&lt;/a&gt; as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any problems or bugs, don’t hesitate to report them &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note to modders: You may have seen these already on the wiki or when we linked to them in the last playtest announcement, but we did not explicitly mention them. In addition to the existing &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Traits"&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Lua-API"&gt;Lua API&lt;/a&gt;  which cover the latest stable release, we now also provide documentation for the latest playtest. See the “&lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Traits-(playtest)"&gt;Traits (playtest)&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Lua-API-(playtest)"&gt;Lua API (playtest)&lt;/a&gt;” pages on our wiki. This will allow you to update your mods and maps to be compatible with an upcoming release ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150531-ra-editor.png" alt="Ingame editor in Red Alert" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A view of the new ingame editor in the Red Alert mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old external editor is slated for removal after the upcoming release, so while the next release will feature both the ingame and legacy editors, it will be the last appearance for the latter. Reason enough to give the ingame editor a thorough testing!&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2015-05-24T10:40:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-05-24T10:40:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20150524/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pulse/monthly"&gt;month of busy development&lt;/a&gt;. Time to get back to testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major changes this time around include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A whole new in-game map editor, with many benefits over the old editor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved system integration with &lt;code&gt;openra://&lt;/code&gt; server join URLs. Give it a try from our &lt;a href="/games/"&gt;live server list&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implemented production building upgrades that unlock additional technology for Dune 2000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several enhanced classic missions have been added to the Tiberian Dawn mod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Red Alert and D2k mods you will now be notified upon encounter of enemy units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an oversight in the way that we package our windows installer meant that the performance of our Windows release-20150429 builds was much worse than it should have been. We have fixed this for playtest-20150524, so Windows players should find the game runs about 30% faster!&lt;br /&gt;
Also general performance improvements have been integrated that affect all platforms. Kudos to &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoosterDragon"&gt;RoosterDragon&lt;/a&gt; for his continued effort to optimize our source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The refined system integration adds a lot of convenient features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware cursors will now work more reliably on Microsoft Windows.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Mac the dialogs won’t hijack finder and the dock icon won’t get lost upon restarting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux AppStream compatible software centers will now show a nice preview.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double-clicking an &lt;code&gt;.orarep&lt;/code&gt; file will now directly start playback of the replay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new in-game map editor took over a year of development time, and it was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is truly cross-platform as it uses our game UI; finally a map editor on Mac OS X!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No more rendering glitches. Almost WYSIWYG editing, because we re-use the game renderer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for all file formats, i.e. voxels, isometric terrain and Dune 2000 sprite actors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can now keep an overview of installed custom maps and delete them in the same menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code&gt;Extras&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;Map Editor&lt;/code&gt; from the main menu in any mod. To all our enthusiastic mappers out there: Your feedback is invaluable at this stage. We will remove the legacy &lt;code&gt;OpenRA.Editor.exe&lt;/code&gt; in the nearby future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great news for tinkerers. You can now use voxels in your own mods and maps. See our updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Traits-(playtest)"&gt;trait documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API-(playtest)"&gt;Lua API&lt;/a&gt; for mission scripting has also been enhanced while we proceed to implement remakes of the original campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details and links to pull request can be found on our &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net/"&gt;changelog page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the installers for a variety of supported operating systems in our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please report problems &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;. We plan to do a new stable release based upon these changes soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150524-ra-map-chooser.png" alt="Red Alert map chooser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Keep track of your thirdparty maps from &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net/"&gt;OpenRA Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and delete unwanted ones in the updated map chooser.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150524-cnc-nod06a.png" alt="Tiberian Dawn mission Nod06a" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One by one the results of the student project to import the original Tiberian Dawn missions is integrated.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.thm.de/site/en/"&gt;THM&lt;/a&gt; course instructors for their creative teaching methods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150524-d2k-building-upgrades.png" alt="Dune 2000 building upgrades" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The on-going quest to &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7751"&gt;finalize the Dune 2000&lt;/a&gt; mod has reached a new milestone&lt;br /&gt;with building upgrades which re-create the original tech tree.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150524-ts-ingame-editor.png" alt="Tiberian Sun in-game map editor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The in-game map editor is also a vital part of our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/5350"&gt;Tiberian Sun support&lt;/a&gt; initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2015-05-05T21:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-05-05T21:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/server-issues/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many of you will already have noticed that we are having some server issues at the moment. The problem is being worked on and we hope to restore all services within the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to inform you of the impacted services and their current status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;OpenRA Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:2em"&gt;
This was probably among the two most visible effects of the outage. It is currently being restored from a backup and will hopefully be available again in the next few days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Hetzner” dedicated servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:2em"&gt;
We were able to replace these relatively quickly with servers hosted on other hardware. Since May 5th, both the replacements and the original servers are up and running again, which is why some server names appear twice in the server browser, by the way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Player statistics on the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:2em"&gt;
We had to remove these eventually to avoid visitors getting greeted with an error dialog. As of right now, they are back, however.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IRC channel bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:2em"&gt;
Our orabot was sorely missed, but is finally among the living again! He says "]hi"!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Game content mirror&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:2em"&gt;
The server also hosted a mirror of our content packages. It was removed from the mirror list while it was down, and others servers from our mirror network took up its job. The mirror is back up and running again now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, only the Resource Center is still offline, but will come back eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to extend thanks to everyone who helped us while the server was down and who are helping us with restoring its function!&lt;/p&gt;
