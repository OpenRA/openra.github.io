    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Release 20190314&lt;/a&gt;, which brings changes developed between August 2018 and January 2019 and polished with the help of player feedback &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190302/"&gt;playtests&lt;/a&gt; during the last 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting change in this release comes from a complete overhaul of the unit targeting logic, which fixes many long-standing bugs and introduces some important improvements to gameplay fluidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic targeting now properly accounts for the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker has been promoted to thief, who can steal cash from refineries as well as vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, Red Alert now features an additional seven single-player missions, and Tiberian Dawn another two. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alert &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Balance changes&lt;/a&gt; include adjustments to the long-controversial Allied Artillery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the map editor, including a map actor editor, a new Copy/Paste filter, and the ability to select multiple terrain categories in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more minor changes and bugfixes, so take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to unwrap all of the details. Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses a number of issues discovered in playtest-20190209.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes in &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190302&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed target cursor issues with buildings under the fog&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed inconsistent “Unit Ready” audio notifications&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed harvesters moving to empty resource fields when unloading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed turrets “twitching” when targeting enemies at their maximum range&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed a collection of map and mission issues in Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Implemented community-driven &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/263d8e2b66e6292dfd798cbe369a7cc5befe4c1d#ra-balance-changes-20190302"&gt;balance changes&lt;/a&gt; for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We expect this to be our final release candidate, which will be repackaged as a new release before the end of March if no further regressions are found.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20180209 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;new playtest build&lt;/a&gt; is now available with a collection of fixes and improvements over &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last playtest made some big changes to how targeting interacts with the Fog of War, which broke a lot more than we expected. Rather than reverting these changes, we decided to go all-in, and replaced even more of the targeting code - a job that we had originally planned for the release after next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new changes should fix not just the regressions in the last playtest, but also several other long-standing gameplay bugs and inconsistencies with the Fog of War, engineers, and aircraft. They also bring two long-requested features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new features, which should go a long way towards improving combat fluidness and the ability to micromanage your forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio notification changes introduced in the last playtest have been refined and expanded by adding click feedback to the sidebar, reducing the volume of the “cash tick” sounds, and normalizing the volume changes between different music tracks. The build is rounded out with fixes for bugs and crashes that were reported in the first playtest — see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/7b4a50814a012c161e68378f7af533e6c2dfd5f7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt; news post for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to give it a try, and let us know what you think in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also back into competitive scene, with Red Alert Global League running its seventh season in March and April. New signups are possible until February 27th; check &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=20868"&gt;the registrations thread&lt;/a&gt; for the relevant information on how you can participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament will build up on the structure changes made in the previous season, but coming engine modifications and improvements are sure to stir things up among the competition. We are also to see whether Barf will be able to break the RAGL tradition and become the first triple champion or this continues further with a new player crowned at the end. As usual, there will be an aim to achieve at any tier, with several spots providing monetary prizes from a publicly collected prize pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit our &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=20869"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; to read all about the tournament and join our &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt; to stay informed on all the day-to-day activities in the community, as well as to discuss games, provide feedback and share your ideas on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190106/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Better late than never, OpenRA is celebrating the new year with our planned “2018 holiday-season” playtest. &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Playtest 20190106&lt;/a&gt; brings some big changes to gameplay mechanics, more single-player content, and even more bug fixes and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change comes to the unit targeting logic, which has been reworked to better understand the Fog of War. This has fixed a collection of long-standing bugs (especially with artillery-style units), however, due to the subtle nature of these changes, more testing is required to predict the impact on overall gameplay and game balance. We hope that the community can rally behind testing and report any issues so that they can be addressed before the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker is now the Thief, who can steal cash from refineries in addition to capturing vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, seven new single-player missions have been ported from the original Red Alert, and another two from Tiberian Dawn. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the development tools. The map editor has been upgraded with a new actor property editor and improved copy/paste tool, and the tile selection sidebar now supports multi-category selections. The mod rule linter has been made more robust, and can now report errors in audio notifications. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20190106"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; has also been updated to work with the new playtest and planned future changes to the &lt;a href="https://resource.openra.net/"&gt;OpenRA Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenRA is developed by volunteers who freely donate their spare time to build games that everybody can enjoy. Playtest 20190106 contains changes from 34 contributors over the last 5 months, and fixes bugs reported by many others. This post covers only some of the changes, so see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/8da02c00e84314555e0f2436b3cf1627f262426d"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playtest releases are our way of crowdsourcing bug reports and feedback so that the next release can be the best it possibly can. This only works if you get involved, play games, and report your feedback. If you do have something to say, please let us know in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/UcUztfr"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtest releases do not overwrite the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server. Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While the next playtest requires a little more time, there are a number of bugs that we wanted to squash before the holiday season. To address these, &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;release-20181215&lt;/a&gt; is now available with the following improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed servers showing as “Waiting” in the server list after play has started.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash in the lobby if the admin changes the map while a player is joining.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed part of the lobby UI disappearing after transferring admin to another player.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed players showing as “Anonymous” in the lobby after switching from another mod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a crash when using the /levelup cheat with units that are already veteran.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed rare crashes when using Attack Move, and when ordering aircraft to land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed bugs with the Chronoshift killing Construction Yards and duplicating MCVs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a glitch if the owner surrenders while a tech-structure is being captured.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed a rare bug where units become uncontrollable after exiting a transport.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed compatibility issues with certain older GPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed tech-structure abilities from campaign-specific buildings in Red Alert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new release, and spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, we are pleased to announce the first public alpha of the &lt;a href="https://www.kknd-game.com/"&gt;Krush Kill ‘n’ Destroy remake&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to rebuild and improve the first two KKnD games using the OpenRA game engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20181215-kknd-alpha.png" alt="Krush Kill 'n' Destroy" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those unlucky to survive the destruction of the great nuclear war were mutated by radiation and viruses.&lt;br /&gt;The so-called Evolved found their way back to their spiritual roots to make sure this never happens again.&lt;br /&gt;When the Survivors emerged from underground 60 years later, the two factions battle to control the overworld.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KKnD remake began in 2011 before making the move to OpenRA in 2016. The team has been working hard since then to develop KKnD’s unique game mechanics (such as the upgrade and parallel construction systems) and integrate many code improvements into the OpenRA engine. The classic KKnD gameplay is enhanced with many small tweaks and quality of life enhancements to meet modern gameplay standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first alpha releases focus on KKnD 1 multiplayer gameplay. The team plans to focus on skirmish games next, before turning their attention to the singleplayer campaigns and the sequel KKnD 2: Krossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See their &lt;a href="https://www.kknd-game.com/news/milestone-0-1-0-release-20181215"&gt;official release announcement&lt;/a&gt; for more information and their &lt;a href="https://www.kknd-game.com/download"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to try it for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
