    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month after the previous playtest, we’re pleased to announce the new release candidate, &lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/download/"&gt;playtest-20170902&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the new features and improvements &lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20170722/"&gt;the previous playtest&lt;/a&gt; brought along, in this new playtest we fixed over 40 issues that were identified through feedback from players and modders. Among the more noticable ones were the movement ‘stuttering’ that ground units were showing, air units sporadically returning to base as well as some issues with the new command bar and some other UI hiccups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Red Alert mod in particular received a larger balance overhaul, along with a new map (Agenda). ‘Agenda’ and the updated ‘Great Sahara 2’ now serve as examples of more prominent use of civilian ‘tech’ structures that provide various benefits when captured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170902-agenda-civ-tech.png" alt="New civilian tech buildings" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new capturable civilian tech structures, displayed on the new map Agenda. Forward Command provides build space, Communications Center reveals terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiberian Dawn’s balance received some further polishing as well, making bridges more robust (in particular to light weapons and flames) as well as making Orcas and rocket infantry less effective versus infantry in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new version of the Mod SDK is &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20170902"&gt;also now available&lt;/a&gt; with a few improvements and bug fixes.  The big new feature is the ability to &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/wiki/Generating-Release-Installers"&gt;automatically create installers&lt;/a&gt; for your mod “in the cloud”.  We encourage everyone who is working on mods for the last release to try out the Mod SDK and report back any issues you find or suggestions that you may have, so that we can iron out any remaining issues before the legacy oramod infrastructure is removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new playtest can be &lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/download/"&gt;downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with the last playtest, we ask you to give this a try and report any bugs or balance issues you might come across, as this will likely be the last playtest before the next release.
The changelog for this playtest (as well as the previous one) can be found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/04b8887b703daf31a2512edfe308cf61ee2a4169"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, Red Alert Global League public registration is closed now. There is still several days before the new season kicks off, but we can now firmly state that this is definitely the biggest open OpenRA tournament to date with a whopping 70 players registered! Will General FiveAces be ready to confront the now unbeatable Lorrydriver and grab back the reign as the triple League champion? Stay tuned for league updates and match highlights!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings, commanders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth iteration of the Red Alert Global League is already in the works, planned to be held from September 11th till December 11th. As always, public registrations are open to anyone willing to participate as well as to those who have already spilled some enemy blood on the grass, snow and desert tiles. Don’t be late as registrations are only open till August 31st. This is your chance to stand against the best Red Alert masters there is, and to add to that there is also a money prize pool involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;League rules and regulations can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=20234"&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt;; registration guidelines are in &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=20235"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish all participants the best of luck and a lot of fun! Lets rock!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Playtest 20170722 out now!</title>
    <published>2017-07-21T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2017-07-21T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20170722/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re pleased to finally announce playtest-20170722, the first release candidate for what will be the biggest OpenRA release in many years.  Core development has focused on three areas, and we have included many other great improvements contributed by our open source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice the first major change before you even start the playtest: the “OpenRA” launcher is no more, and has been replaced with individual launchers for Red Alert, Tiberian Dawn, and Dune 2000.  This is part of a major reorganisation of the project structure to improve backwards compatibility and modding support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170722-launchers.png" alt="New launchers" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Individual mods are now launched directly from your Desktop / Application Launcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-game mod chooser has been removed, but it is still possible to switch mods when joining a server from the Multiplayer list.  Even better, if you have multiple versions installed (e.g. Playtest and Release, which now install to different locations on Windows) the server list will show games from &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; versions, and will switch to the correct version when you try to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second focus area relates to how you control your units on the battlefield.  For many years we have supported features like Attack Move, unit stances and queuing orders using hotkeys, but these have not always been obvious or intuitive to use.  We have added a long-planned command bar interface for these, and made some adjustments and bug fixes to make them better and behave more like the original games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170722-ra-commandbar.png" alt="Unit command bar" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A new bottom command bar is now available for issuing common orders and changing unit stances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final focus area fundamentally changes the way that buildings occupy space and receive damage, taking inspiration from the original Dune 2000, which was more advanced than the earlier (and some later!) games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170722-td-buildinghitshapes.png" alt="Building hit boxes" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New building physics improves the way that structures are targeted and take damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the smaller but still important new features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic discovery of LAN games in the Multiplayer browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to the Global Chat UI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New search and filtering options in the Map editor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another 9 campaign missions for D2K, which is now half way complete!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Missing maps can now be installed directly from the Replay browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significant performance and memory improvements when playing music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/f4a27f19459d2dd35d4bc08a75a741363f146422"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for information on many more improvements that we have not mentioned here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170722-d2k-editor.png" alt="New D2K missions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to search and filter actors and tiles in the map editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This playtest includes big changes which may have broken your favourite feature, and which have definitely affected the game balance in all three mods.  This makes it more important than ever to play games on this and future playtests and let us know of any issues via &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, or in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget, if you’re on Windows or macOS you can have playtest-20170722 and release-20170527 installed at the same time, and switch between the two when joining servers with other players.  So head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for a special note to our modding community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As OpenRA modding grew in popularity it became clear that requiring players to manually install mods &lt;em&gt;on top of&lt;/em&gt; our OpenRA releases, with the in-game mod chooser to switch between mods, was more of a burden than a benefit.  We have listened to the feedback from both players and modders, and have spent the last few months working on a comprehensive solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done this by decoupling the game engine (OpenRA.Game.exe and support files) from our default mods, and have put &lt;em&gt;the mod&lt;/em&gt; in charge.  Mods now manage their own engine files, which means that they can exist &lt;em&gt;alongside&lt;/em&gt; our official mods with no dependencies between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK"&gt;mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; provides a development environment that simplifies the engine and dependency management, and allows you to generate proper installers for players to install your game.  Games built with the mod SDK will not be affected when the player upgrades or even uninstalls other OpenRA-based games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mod SDK is still a new project, and our documentation is still rough.  We encourage modders who want to port their projects over to the SDK to file issues if you have any problems, or visit our &lt;a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/openra"&gt;development IRC channel&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra"&gt;webchat&lt;/a&gt;) if you have any questions during european-timezone evenings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are proud to celebrate the 10th anniversary of OpenRA today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community member SoScared put together a new fantastic promotional trailer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/93b7TKooj-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we are working towards a new playtest. Some core improvements and additions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new unit control bar that provides mouse and touch accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unit stances that are easier to use and behave more like the original games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overhauled structure hit boxes, with weapons/engineers/etc. accounting for their physical size instead of acting only at their centre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic discovery of LAN games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So stay tuned and happy playing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new bugfix release that addresses a collection of issues that were missed during the playtesting phase of release-20170421.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The main changes in release-20170527 are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Disabled HiDPI support on Windows, fixing the graphical glitches this caused on non-HiDPI displays.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed cursor glitches introduced with the new Mono 5.0 runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed graphical glitches with the Fullscreen (Legacy) mode on macOS.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added a new “Fast” game speed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A collection of smaller fixes are listed in the  &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/798ebb12353ed12ed4569640d773cba7a6f45505"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new release, and spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/release-20170421/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for release-20170421 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost to the day half a year after our last stable release, we are proud to finally present to you our latest work - OpenRA Release 20170421!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 43 developers producing just shy of 800 commits and touching almost 1800 files, this has very likely been one of our slowest release cycles ever. As such, the list of user-visible changes is not as long as you’ve come to expect in earlier years. However, behind the scenes, preparations for a fundamental transformation of the OpenRA engine are in the works. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this new release brings with it changes to the balance of both the Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn mods, as well as a huge number of new and overhauled multiplayer maps. In addition, it contains the following major fixes and features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HiDPI font rendering for players with high resolution displays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several multiplayer bugs that could stall or crash games when a player disconnects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Red Alert “shell map” background is now muted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New behaviour for the Red Alert Gap Generator and Tiberian Dawn Obelisk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for asset installation on 32 bit operating systems and from the original RA95 CDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dune 2000 mod in particular has many changes to make it better match the gameplay and graphical polish of the original game, plus seven(!) new campaign missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170421-td-hidpi.gif" alt="HiDPI support" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Comparing regular and high resolution UI rendering in the Tiberian Dawn map browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170421-d2k-new-missions.png" alt="New Dune 2000 missions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Dune 2000 now comes with 13 campaign missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170421-ra-gapgen.png" alt="New Gap Generator behaviour" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The re-written shroud-generating behaviour of the gap generator in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest changes in this release are behind the scenes; technical improvements that are not visible to players, but important for our development and modding community:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Trait-Conditions"&gt;trait conditions&lt;/a&gt; system provides much better control over trait interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Actor vision has been overhauled, adding support for features like the RA active gap generators, D2K actors revealing themselves when attacking, and cliffs blocking vision in heightmap-enabled mods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplified weapon definitions using inherited yaml templates.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some initial steps towards removing code patterns that are not compatible with save game support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenRA grew out of the C&amp;amp;C modding community, and one of our major goals is to provide a flexible game engine that the community can use for their own projects.  Unfortunately, this goal has been hurt by OpenRA’s single-engine approach, meaning that every new release would unavoidably break community mods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After many discussions, we have developed a new mod support strategy that we will implement over the next two OpenRA releases.  This release starts by adding support for parallel OpenRA installs, and we have started developing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModTemplate"&gt;mod template&lt;/a&gt; that includes instructions and scripts to simplify mod development and packaging.  Mods built using this template will be self contained games that function independently from our official mod installs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-game multiplayer server list will now list games for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the mods that a player has installed (even across multiple installations), and will allow players to directly switch to another mod when joining one.  This applies across versions as well as mods, meaning that future OpenRA releases will be able to coexist, and switching between release and playtest servers will be just as easy as switching between RA and TD servers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20170304-mpmodswitch.png" alt="New MP server list switcher" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The multiplayer server list is now smarter about multiple OpenRA installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next release (later this year) will complete the mod-support transition by removing the in-game mod chooser and support for manually installed mod packages: all mods (both official and community) will be listed individually with their own names and icons in your Start Menu / Dock / Launcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these measures will give more visibility to third-party mods, and establish OpenRA as a viable and stable real-time strategy platform even for games not connected to the Command &amp;amp; Conquer universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the complete list of changes please see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/33cef396555bd767f9126d4775e20324ae05c235"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;. You can find installers for all our supported operating systems on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;
