ALL ENEMY OPPOSITION.

CONFIRMATION CODE 2169.

TRANSMISSION ENDS.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A release-20161019 hotfix is now available with fixes for two critical multi-player bugs that were missed during the playtesting phase. The original announcement for release-20161015 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to announce the latest stable release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this cycle has seen relatively little changes to the core game code with just about 28,000 changed lines, the new features and fixes it yields make up for it by being very visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first place you will notice this is the much improved game content installer. It is now able to copy and install game assets from many more installation sources, such as the original release CDs, the First Decade DVDs, installed copies of the Dune 2000 Gruntsmod edition and even the C&amp;amp;C Ultimate Edition from Origin. Additionally, for the first time ever, the content installer will now also automatically install the campaign briefing videos, which means you no longer have to do that manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-ra-contentinstaller.png" alt="Game content installer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This features comes with one minor down-side: since the new assets are installed into a different place than in previous versions of OpenRA, every player is required to install the game assets again when launching this new version for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, our quest to complete porting the original campaign missions to OpenRA is ongoing. This time around, there are seven new missions for Tiberian Dawn, and one each for Red Alert and Dune 2000. For Red Alert, there are also three new missions which can be played in both single- and cooperative multiplayer mode and which long-time players may find to be vaguely familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other new features and fixes include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a lot of crashes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes to a number of bugs that impacted game servers, such as the infamous “grey ping bug”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New configuration options for customizing mouse scrolling behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for navigating to map edges, and bookmarking positions on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys for controlling the music player, as well as producing five units at once.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved aircraft reloading behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more changes than we are able to mention here, including the usual round of balance changes. Head on over to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/0ae64ef1b6dded0a55900ab67561c2d56885c461"&gt;Changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt; to see the complete list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-d2k-scorescreen.png" alt="Score Screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Instead of kills and losses the score screen now shows an actual score comprised of the amount of kills as well as other gameplay actions such as capturing and infiltrating buildings, repairing an allies’ units and buildings, and sending them supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161015-td-burningtrees.png" alt="Burning trees" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Burning trees now provide nice visual effects for flame throwers and nukes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find installers for all supported operating systems on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;. On that topic, OpenRA now requires .NET 4.5 (Windows) / Mono 3.2 or greater (OS X and Linux). Players using Ubuntu 12.04 or other Linux distributions that include Mono 2.10 can upgrade to a supported version by following the instructions on the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives"&gt;Mono site&lt;/a&gt;. Windows XP users will need to upgrade to a supported OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you will enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2016-09-30T20:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-09-30T20:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20161001/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to release the second playtest of this development cycle! This refines and fixes the many new features that we added in &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20160904/"&gt;playtest-20160904&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for a final release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 5,000 people have tried out the previous playtest, which is about twice as many as usual. Thanks to everyone one of those people for testing and contributing back! Stable releases would not be possible without you. We now count on you to check out this playtest as rigorously as the first one. With any luck, this might be the last chance to report issues before the stable release, so don’t miss it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual we have fixed quite a few bugs, many of them very visible and annoying. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Servers becoming unusable in various ways (grey ping, kicking players on joining, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some hotkeys not working (closing the ingame chat window, navigation hotkeys in the TD mod).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft reloading behaviour still having problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support power speech notifications missing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crashes for various reasons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues in mission scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have tweaked the balance of the RA mod some more. Most notably, spies have received the ability to infiltrate and reveal fake buildings, and Soviet missile submarines now have an AA capability. Be sure to give those a good workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20161001-ra-lobby-mission-briefing.png" alt="Mission briefing shown in the lobby chat" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Selecting a multiplayer mission will now show the mission briefing in the lobby chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the complete list of fixes and changes, have a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/a102a48028e95521b5bdc313865e02985ba2a108"&gt;complete changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be aware of the following two things when taking this playtest out for a spin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Because we have changed which assets are copied, all players coming from one of the previous &lt;em&gt;stable&lt;/em&gt; releases will need to reinstall (or redownload) the assets for this playtest. These will be used for the future playtests and releases, so only needs to be done once.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Please note that OpenRA now requires .NET 4.5 / Mono 3.2 or greater. Players using Ubuntu 12.04 or other Linux distributions that include Mono 2.10 can upgrade to a supported version by following the instructions on the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives"&gt;Mono site&lt;/a&gt;. Windows XP users will need to upgrade to a supported OS.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the installers for a variety of operating systems can be found on the &lt;a href="/download"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; page. Please remember to report any bugs or issues you encounter on our &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;GitHub bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra"&gt;our IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80"&gt;community forum&lt;/a&gt;, or in the comment section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20160904/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we’re happy to finally announce the first release candidate for our next OpenRA release.
The new playtest contains over 1200 commits by 38 authors (including 11 first-time committers, thanks to all of you!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rely on players to thoroughly test the playtest builds to catch any bugs or balance regressions before the final release, so head over to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to try it out today! If you encounter a bug, or have any feedback, then please create a ticket on our &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;Github issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra"&gt;find us on IRC&lt;/a&gt;, create a topic &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80"&gt;on our community forum&lt;/a&gt;, or leave a message in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work in this release has focused on improving our core engine technology and paying down technical debt. The first place you will notice this is the mod chooser, which now understands the various install disks and digitial distributions of the original games. It can now automatically find and install all of the assets used by the mods, including the full motion videos and the additional music tracks included with the expansion disks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160904-cnc-contentinstall.png" alt="New content installer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we have changed which assets are copied, all players will need to reinstall (or redownload) the assets for this playtest. These will be used for the future playtests and releases, so only needs to be done once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new FMV installation support has arrived just in time (some would argue far too late!), because this playtest includes 7 more campaign missions for TD and one new campaign mission each for RA and D2K. RA also includes three custom multiplayer missions that can be selected from the mission chooser (for singleplayer) or the multiplayer lobby (for cooperative play).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes in this release include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to unit pathfinding behaviour (less traffic jams around bridges and choke points!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft in RA will now intelligently manage their reloading behaviour at airfields or helipads&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New hotkeys and mouse bindings for moving around the map and producing units&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lobby options (such as crates and shroud) are no longer reset when switching maps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved UPnP support for automatically opening ports when hosting local servers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for a collection of common crashes that sneaked in to the last release (we’re sorry about that!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of balance changes for RA and TD that were discussed and tested on our &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=82"&gt;community forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many trait and Lua API improvements for mods and maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160904-ra-aiengineer.png" alt="AI Engineers" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Watch your back! We have taught the AI to use Engineers to capture tech buildings and enemy structures.
&lt;br /&gt;
A controversial exploit allowing engineers to cancel production in the RA mod has also been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160904-d2k-playerscore.png" alt="Player scores" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A new scoring system tracks many ingame actions, not just kills.
&lt;br /&gt;
The redesigned score menu now also lists the spectators that are observing the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160904-cnc-burningtrees.png" alt="Burning trees" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We have restored the ability for flame weapons to burn trees down to charred husks.
&lt;br /&gt;
Try the playtest today to find all the other cosmetic improvements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/aaf2e4ae786bbb938c321a34a35319311bb79a1e"&gt;the full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for more details, and head over to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to try it for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that OpenRA now requires .NET 4.5 / Mono 3.2 or greater. Players using Ubuntu 12.04 or other Linux disributions that include Mono 2.10 can upgrade to a supported version by following the instructions on the &lt;a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/#debian-ubuntu-and-derivatives"&gt;Mono site&lt;/a&gt;. Players who are still on Windows XP will need to upgrade to a supported OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="about-todo-divider"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is steadily progressing on our official Tiberian Sun mod and the “gen2” engine overhaul required to support it and other community-developed mods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160904-ts-teaser.png" alt="TS Promo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this last release cycle we completed the first step (a year in the making) of a major project to support the per-pixel depth calculations required to correctly render the TS world. Gameplay advancements include finishing support for the EMP cannon and player-controllable Carryalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work remains on both the engine and gameplay fronts. Please understand that this is a long-term project, and it will not be completed any time soon with our current developer manpower. We have plans for making future development versions more accessible for testing, but because the project is developed by volunteers in their free time we cannot predict when it will be complete enough to include in an official OpenRA release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2016-08-21T16:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-08-21T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/ragls2-registrations/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160821-ragls2-banner.png" alt="Red Alert Global League Season 2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings commanders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="/news/ragl-season1-conclusion"&gt;its very successful first season&lt;/a&gt;, Season 2 of the Red Alert Global League is about to kick off on September 5th. Ahead of its official start, the registrations have been opened to the general public. So if you have not yet participated in the league, but wish to do so, now would be the time to act, as registrations will close on August 31st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The league’s rules are laid out in &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=19750"&gt;this forum thread&lt;/a&gt;, while information how to get your name registered is found &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=19734"&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize pool this time around is already at over $500, which I personally find quite astonishing. It will be well worth everyone’s time to try and get your share of the cake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wish all participants the best of luck and a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="openra-development-news"&gt;OpenRA development news&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the next release of OpenRA is not quite ready yet, we would like to give you a sneak peek at what we have been up to in the last few months and some of the things that you can expect to see in the hopefully not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160821-sneakpeek-ai-capturing.png" alt="AI capturing an oil derrick" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI will gain the ability to capture buildings. Additionally, several bugs regarding the AI’s handling of MCVs were fixed, as well as bug that made the AI eventually stop production of infantry units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160821-sneakpeek-score-screen.png" alt="Changed score screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next release will feature a new scoring system that not only incorporates kills, but also capturing, infiltrations, repairing or healing allied buildings and units, and sending supply trucks. Please note that these scores are purely cosmetic and do not actually have influence on the outcome of matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160821-sneakpeek-content-installer.png" alt="New content installer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content installation has been completely overhauled and will finally allow users to install game music and campaign briefing videos with a click of a button. In addition to the installation via CD or the download option, it will be possible to transfer assets from existing installations of the Origin versions of the games, or the Gruntsmod variant for Dune 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the singleplayer front, Tiberian Dawn’s Nod campaign will make a huge jump forward with the addition of six(!) new missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-time players may remember the cooperative multiplayer missions that have been shipped as part of OpenRA up to release-20131223, and which had to be dropped with the removal of the C#-based scripting engine. We are very happy to say that our Lua API is now powerful enough that these missions could be recreated and will be available again, playable in both single- and multiplayer modes!&lt;/p&gt;
