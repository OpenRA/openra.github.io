&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than three months, the very successful Season 1 of the Red Alert Global League, hosted by our community member SoScared, is officially over! Here is what he has to say in his own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding:10px; margin:10px;"&gt;
With 184 registered matches played over the course of three months, season 1 of the Red Alert Global League is officially concluded! A big thank you for everyone participating this season, laying the cornerstone for a continuous competetive event and a venue for people to meet and play some good games, both for fun and for prestige. But before we start planning future filled stadiums on par with LoL events, let's have a closer look at how season 1 went for our participating players.

&lt;p&gt;The final matches of the Masters' and Minions' Divisions came in late but managed to hold off the end results and a lot of anticipation for the league's top placements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Masters' Division&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Masters' Division &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; was to match &lt;em&gt;Medium Tank&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt; to fight for the last four points after &lt;em&gt;Murto The Ray&lt;/em&gt; took a twp-point lead when completing all his games for the season. &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt;' first match-up vs &lt;em&gt;Medium Tank&lt;/em&gt; looked to be a league clencher after a quick strong-armed win for &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Medium Tank&lt;/em&gt;'s host map Ore Lord but with a surprise turn of events on &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt;' host map Singles, &lt;em&gt;Medium Tank&lt;/em&gt; managed to take away a point after pulling off both of Ukraine's special traits within minutes of each other, blasting his way through the middle and making his way towards &lt;em&gt;FiveAces'&lt;/em&gt; main base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one point away from the top still, the last match-up vs &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt; proved to be a big toss-up after &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt; delivered a grade-A match on his host map Ore Lord and took a match point, leaving &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; with one last match and final shot at winning the League. On map Sidestep, &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; final host map, the battle turned out to be a slug fest after both players got their radar dome and tech center (both spawning Soviet) before their first expansion &amp;ndash; normally an unprescedented move on the map but with both players going for the same unorthodox opener the match unraveled into a World War 1 style of death and destruction leaving both sides with huge asset losses. The game flowed back and forth but at one point when it looked like &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; was about to be completely contained in his main base, &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt; overcommitted with shock troopers against &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt;' V2s left and right, leaving &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt; with little assets left to contain &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; at his main base. &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; eventually reclaimed his original first expansion and started to gain on one of his main strength as an OpenRA player &amp;ndash; durability &amp;ndash; which allowed him to engage in favorable battles against a fatigued &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt;, supported by harassing MiGs, making the match somewhat one-sided the last five minutes. &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; claimed victory after pushing with a Heavy Tank-based army, cleaning up &lt;em&gt;Klaas&lt;/em&gt;' first and second expansions in one swoop before knocking on the front door of his main base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The League title for &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; is claimed after a tie-breaker with &lt;em&gt;Murto The Ray&lt;/em&gt;, referring to their earlier match-up in which &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; won a 2-0, avoiding an additional best-of-5 tie-breaker to decide the winner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;em&gt;FiveAces&lt;/em&gt; for a great performance in the Masters' Division of the first season of the Red Alert Global League, resulting in a champion title, bragging rights and a nice lump sum of $145 as a division winner! &lt;em&gt;Murto The Ray&lt;/em&gt; claims 2nd place prize of $55 and &lt;em&gt;Medium Tank&lt;/em&gt; 3rd place prize of $25!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Minions' Division&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with the Masters' Division the Minions' Division's top spot was decided in the last round. The top three spots in the Minions' Division were contended by &lt;em&gt;Abcdefg30&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kazu&lt;/em&gt; and myself (&lt;em&gt;SoScared&lt;/em&gt;) throughout the entire season. With a super close race all the way to the end it all came down to a delayed match-up between &lt;em&gt;Abcdefg30&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kazu&lt;/em&gt;. After a decisive 2-0 victory for &lt;em&gt;Kazu&lt;/em&gt; he managed to claim the first place with a well earned $40 payout, pushing me down to second and &lt;em&gt;Abcdefg30&lt;/em&gt; to third place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;em&gt;Kazu&lt;/em&gt; for winning the Minions' Division Season 1, taking the competetive scene by storm with rock solid performance, making a name for himself in the community and we look forward to see him play in the next season's Masters' Divsion!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forfeits in the Masters' Divsion opened up for 5 promotional spots in the Minions' for division advancement. The top five Minions' players &lt;em&gt;Kazu&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SoScared&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Abcdefg30&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hamb&lt;/em&gt; (4th) and &lt;em&gt;Testosterone Rex&lt;/em&gt; (5th) will have the opportunity to add on to the top division's ultra competetive scene next season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recruit Division&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to the divisions above the Recruit Division has been running with a top contender favourite, &lt;em&gt;OzzyOuzu&lt;/em&gt;, which at the start of the season declared his intent on finishing at the very top. He delivered on his promise and lost only one match against &lt;em&gt;Flecken&lt;/em&gt;, managing to distance himself by four points to the second place, held by player &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;. Below &lt;em&gt;OzzyOuzu&lt;/em&gt; the rest of the field was involved in a tight race for the top spots which ended up having six advancement slots into the next seasons' Minions' Division. Together with &lt;em&gt;OzzyOuzo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;, player &lt;em&gt;Flecken&lt;/em&gt; (3rd), &lt;em&gt;Han&lt;/em&gt; (4th), &lt;em&gt;GoldenHippo&lt;/em&gt; (5th) and &lt;em&gt;DazUltra&lt;/em&gt; (6th) will have the opportunity to play in the next season's Minions' Division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;em&gt;OzzyOuzo&lt;/em&gt; for delivering on his promise to ace the field and secure his advancement into the Minions' Division and for making himseld a serious contender for future play in the Master's Division!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also kudos to all the players in the Recruit Division for staying the course in a field of absent matches towards the end of the season and a special thanks to player &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; who despite having less competetive experience compared to the field still completed every match in his division, taking the initiative on his weekly matches and contributing to the health and legitimacy of the Recruit Division's first season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thank you everyone!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Alert Global League has benefited from a flying start thanks to the interest and involvement of all its participating players. From the viewpoint of the time the idea of a Red Alert league was conceived the experience of season 1 has surpassed all expectations with countless of great games and a considerable prizepool. We can look towards the next season with anticipation but first it will be crucial to review and improve upon the established format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Looking forward to Season 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, the next season of RAGL is aimed to take off on Monday, September 5th. This gives us limited time to advance the format before the next season but is aimed towards establishing Sep-Nov and March-May seasons which would then have stable 3 month in-betweens. Registrations for season 2 will be open between August 15th-31st. Existing players will have August 1st through 31st to confirm their spots in the league.&lt;/p&gt;

Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;
SoScared
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final standings, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&amp;amp;t=19531"&gt;league tables thread&lt;/a&gt; on our forums. Replays of all league matches are available &lt;a href="http://64hdb.mine.nu:5534/mIRROR/ora_replays/RAGL_Season_One/"&gt;from a dedicated file server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenRA team congratulates all winners and thanks all the participants of this first season. We hope that the next season will be even more successful, so be sure to enlist as soon as registrations open in four weeks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings ladies and gentlemen,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our good friend Hecthor Doomhammer welcomes you all to the first ever Hecthor Doomhammer Red Alert 1vs1 Tournament!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Tournament unlike any other where contestants are subjected to a new challenge each round to keep them out of their comfort zone and constantly on their toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting July 2nd at 10:00am GMT/12:00pm CEST a field of 16 challengers will be waging a two-weekend war to decide who will take the honor, glory and the prize money on July 10th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize pool currently consists of a whopping €160 and will be scaled according to the number of signups. In the case of only eight to twelve contestants signing up it will be decreased to €100, should there be seven or less to €60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complete tournament will be hosted and livestreamed from &lt;a href="http://www.twitch.tv/pauljongejans"&gt;Hecthor Doomhammer’s Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;. Joining him will be his fellow casters SoScared and FiveAces as well as well-known community figures Jazz_KCS and Ripsn as tournament officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2016-05-08T18:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-05-08T18:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/release-20160508/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160508-newspost-banner.png" alt="OpenRA Release 20160508" style="border-radius:10px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce a new stable release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Development for this release started about six months ago, and in this time 50 developers contributed a total of 1,232 commits that added more than 14,000 lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of work went into fixing minor bugs and omissions to make the game experience more pleasant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nod units in the Tiberian Dawn campaign finally use their original silver coloring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting a game after installing a map no longer causes the player to be kicked from the server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The lobby color validator will no longer complain as much as it used to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walls now reliably stop bullets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Husks blocking refineries can now be targeted and destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also added the much-requested feature to restart missions and skirmish games, but this does not yet extend to multi-player games. Furthermore, the minimap radar will now also make use of team colors if those are enabled. Health bars can be set to only appear when the unit is damaged. Finally, the “Fragile Diplomacy” option has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UI-wise, issues with the left-click orders have been fixed. Additionally, it is now possible to zoom using Ctrl/Cmd+Scrollwheel (the spectator view and map editor offer two additional zoom levels). Two new modifier keys allow disabling line-building of walls (hold Shift during placement) and canceling an entire build queue (hold Ctrl when clicking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But besides all of that, the biggest changes have been under the hood of OpenRA. We already addressed these topics in the playtest news posts [&lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20160403/#dedicated-server-changes"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20160424/#changes-to-map-handling"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;], and wiki pages covering them have been updated or written from scratch, but to summarize them again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dedicated server is now a stand-alone executable, and dedicated servers no longer need to synchronize maps with the resource center. See the &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Dedicated"&gt;dedicated server wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The map format has been updated, and the way that the game handles map upgrades has been changed. A &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/map-format"&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; has been created to describe the current map format.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In order to allow for packaging mods into single “.oramod” files, it was necessary to introduce a number of changes to the &lt;code&gt;mod.yaml&lt;/code&gt; metadata file. These changes, and the layout of the &lt;code&gt;mod.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file in general, are now documented &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/mod-manifest"&gt;on the wiki&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, the wiki also has the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/3424a4767409ef53318d7fe6f6cc8bc22d06b992"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; which lists all of the changes included in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the installer for your operating system on our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you will enjoy this latest installment of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Another playtest hot off the presses!</title>
    <published>2016-04-24T10:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-04-24T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20160424/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are happy to present to you the second playtest in this release cycle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many users – indeed more than we anticipated (over 2000!) – have tried out the first playtest and gave us a lot of feedback. Almost inevitably, a number of bugs were reported (thanks to all the testers who took their time to do so!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now fixed all of those issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crashes when opening the in-game menu on some maps (Fort Lonestar, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Broken left click orders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too many infantry units coming out of sold buildings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submarines not being targetable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stealth units being targetable even when stealthed under some circumstances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Red Alert mod has seen more refinements to its map pool: a few lower quality maps have been removed, while some new tournament-grade maps have been added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the complete list of changes can be seen &lt;a href="http://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4ad573f5615b1cdaebdd0d8c5a4c09bcb042798a"&gt;on our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We promised in the last news post to detail the new map format and other map-related changes here. Skip to below the break for the full scoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installers for all supported operating systems are available from &lt;a href="/download"&gt;the download page&lt;/a&gt;. Of course we are still interested to hear about any bugs and issues you come across, so please don’t hesitate to report them &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in the OpenRA &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;, or here in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we’d like to address a topic already mentioned in the previous news post. In order to get a better understanding of the composition of our user base and the way our software is being used, we decided to add an anonymous, opt-out data gathering facility to OpenRA. When enabled, the game will send us a few technical details about your system.
There was some controversy over this feature during the first playtest, so we would like to reiterate that this only sends the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An anonymous ID (e.g. “5ba68aa1-1ee8-4d6d-b197-51681347f252”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your OS version (e.g. “Windows: Microsoft Windows NT 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1” or “OSX: Unix 14.5.0.0”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your .NET runtime version (e.g. “.NET CLR 4.0.30319.42000” or “Mono 4.0.2 ((detached/c99aa0c) CLR 4.0.30319.17020”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your GL driver version (e.g. “4.5.0 NVIDIA 352.63” or “3.0 Mesa 10.5.9”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your OS language setting (e.g. “en” or “ru”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The OpenRA version / mod / modversion that you launched&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are uncomfortable with this, you can disable this functionality by unchecking the “Send System Information” checkbox in the advanced settings dialog, manually editing your &lt;code&gt;settings.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file, or starting the game using the &lt;code&gt;Debug.SendSystemInformation=false&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial results from the first playtest have been promising: the vast majority (approximately 99%) of players are able to run the newer .NET runtime platform that we are hoping to make our minimum requirement in a future version. This means that we will be able to take advantage of new platform features to improve performance, identify bugs, and improve operating system integration without leaving many players behind. We also find that 40% of our players do not use English as their primary language, which suggests that it may be worthwhile for us to focus on translation support in a future OpenRA release. Of course, we realize that our playtesters are a biased sample of our overall player base, so we will wait for results from our next release build before we make any final decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160424-os-shares.png" alt="Share of operating systems of our users" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is the share of operating systems and languages among playtest users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="changes-to-map-handling"&gt;Changes to map handling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom maps are now stored in an additional sub-directory per mod version (e.g. &lt;code&gt;My Documents\OpenRA\maps\ra\playtest-20160403&lt;/code&gt; on Windows).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure that outdated maps will not cause problems during gameplay, these maps will not be automatically moved when you upgrade the game. You will have to download updated versions from the &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; instead, or upgrade and move them yourself (see below). Note that the maps from the first playtest are compatible with this one (and will very likely also be compatible with the final release), so you can just copy them over, or rename the directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="map-format-changes"&gt;Map format changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current map format (from playtest-20160403 onwards) is version 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In previous versions (up to release-20151224), the game used to automatically update maps with earlier map formats to the latest one supported by that version. As of playtest-20160403, this is no longer the case. To update maps, you have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;--upgrade-map&lt;/code&gt; command of the OpenRA.Utility.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download an updated version of the map from the Resource Center, or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the Resource Center to upgrade the map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-web-resource-center-map-upgrade.png" alt="Upgrading maps in the resource center" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new map format brings with it a couple advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimap preview is embeddeded into the map package as a separate PNG file,&lt;br /&gt;allowing third-party tools and websites immediate access.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;YAML rules and Lua scripts can be split into multiple files, which can be shared among multiple maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One noteable change that needs explanation is the removal of the &lt;code&gt;Description:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Options:&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Videos:&lt;/code&gt; blocks, whose properties have been moved to their corresponding traits. During map upgrades, these translations will happen automatically. Take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20160403/mods/ra/maps/allies-01"&gt;one of our single-player missions&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20160403/mods/ra/maps/fort-lonestar"&gt;Fort Lonestar map&lt;/a&gt; to see how these work now, or search for the following traits in our &lt;a href="http://wiki.openra.net/Traits%20(Playtest)"&gt;trait documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Here we go again! New Playtest available!</title>
    <published>2016-04-03T10:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2016-04-03T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20160403/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the first playtest leading up to our next stable release!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have finally entered the feature freeze phase of the development cycle, where we stop adding features and focus on fixing bugs found during playtesting. This is where &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; come into play! We need &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; help to give this playtest as wide a test coverage as possible to ensure another successful stable release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We therefore ask you to please report any and all bugs and problems you encounter on &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, in the OpenRA &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;, or here in the comments. We will strive to fix as many bugs as possible before a final release. Thank you for helping to improve OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are the usual bug fixes and improvements, a big focus over the last six months has been reworking several fundamental parts of the OpenRA game engine, with changes that will be felt foremost by server operators, modders and mappers. In fact, some of these changes are so fundamental that we will address them in-depth in the articles covering future playtests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing after the other…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ingame-changes"&gt;Ingame changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few long-standing annoyances have been addressed during the last cycle. Just to name a few, players will no longer be kicked from the server after installing a map, walls now stop bullets reliably, and husks can finally be targeted on refineries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes and new features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By popular demand, a tech level without super-powers has been added to the Red Alert mod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zooming is now possible by holding CTRL while scrolling your mouse wheel. For spectators and in the map editor, two additional zoom steps are available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cancelling an entire build queue at once is now possible by using CTRL + right click.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static defenses will now stop tracking their targets once it is out of range. This also sometimes prevented camo pillboxes from cloaking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Line-building of walls can now be disabled by holding the Shift key while placing the wall element.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A couple of issues related to left-click controls have been solved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers will no longer be selected when you drag-select a group of combat units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fragile diplomacy has been removed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots of minor fixes, UI polish and performance improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, both the Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert mod have received some balance changes. Additionally, a number of Red Alert maps have been revised to be more balanced. A complete list of all these changes can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/2ce4c1d37618b85fb4af3964dd1e87ded5013de4"&gt;in the changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-cnc-restart-dialog.png" alt="Restart dialog" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Players finally have a restart option after failing a mission or skirmish!
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-ra-team-colors.png" alt="Team colors and health bar improvements" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
When team colors are enabled in the settings, they will now be used on the radar map.&lt;br /&gt;
You can also set health bars to only appear when units are damaged.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-cnc-nod-colors.png" alt="Nod units with proper color" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
This is for the nostalgic ones among us (and who isn't?).&lt;br /&gt;
Nod units in missions now show their proper silver colors known from the original game.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-d2k-worm-trail.png" alt="Worm trails" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Worms have received some polish and now leave a trail similar to the one from the original game.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mapping-and-modding-changes"&gt;Mapping and modding changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that the game handles maps has changed significantly since the last release.  We will elaborate on the changes and the reasons for them in a future post, but for now you only really need to know three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maps from release-20151224 and earlier must be upgraded before they will work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maps are now installed into per-version subdirectories – like replays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Installing maps ingame and using the map editor works as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-web-resource-center-map-upgrade.png" alt="Upgrading maps in the resource center" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The maps currently available on &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;the OpenRA Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; are in the process of being updated,&lt;br /&gt;and we have added an option for you to upgrade your maps manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support for third-party mods will significantly improve with the next release. It is now possible to create an archive of your whole mod (called “.oramod”). Installing it on other computers is then just a matter of placing that archive in the “mods” subdirectory of the Support folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news post for the second playtest will detail what changes your mod needs to make it compatible with the upcoming release and to enable the .oramod packaging. All shipped mods have already been converted, so feel free to take a look at those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, OpenRA will feature an ingame mod browser that will allow you to search for and install mods directly from the Resource Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dedicated-server-changes"&gt;Dedicated server changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated servers have been made a lot easier to operate for the next release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 85%; border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding:10px; margin:10px;"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;
$ ./OpenRA.Server.exe Game.Mod=ra Server.Name="My Server" Server.DisableSinglePlayer=true &lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:06:10] Starting dedicated server for mod: ra&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:06:11] Master server communication established.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:10:08] Antares has joined the game.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:10:56] Player has joined the game.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:11:49] Newbie has joined the game.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:12:16] Antares changed the map to Doughnut.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:13:41] Game started&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:38] Player has disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:47] Antares has disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:54] Newbie has disconnected.&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:54] No one is playing, shutting down...&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:54] Starting a new server instance...&lt;br /&gt;
[2016-04-02T16:37:55] Master server communication established.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the biggest change is that dedicated servers no longer need to sync maps with the Resource Center. Especially when you were running multiple servers of different versions, this could quickly become a headache. Another advantage is that the distinction between synced and unsynced servers will go away. That’s right: maps uploaded to the Resource Center will be available immediately, on all servers, without any further action required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another change is that there is now a dedicated executable for dedicated servers, &lt;code&gt;OpenRA.Server.exe&lt;/code&gt; (and a matching &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/openra-server&lt;/code&gt; on Linux). As a consequence, the old &lt;code&gt;Server.Dedicated&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Server.DedicatedLoop&lt;/code&gt; command-line arguments no longer exist. If you are using custom scripts to start your server instances, you will need to adapt them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last, unrelated change is that the &lt;code&gt;Server.AllowBots&lt;/code&gt; flag has been removed in favor of a &lt;code&gt;Server.DisableSinglePlayer&lt;/code&gt; flag, which will allow people to play with bots on servers, but only if there is more than one human player in the game. &lt;code&gt;Server.DisableSinglePlayer&lt;/code&gt; defaults to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;, so be sure to set it if desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for a general overview of the upcoming release. For a detailed list of changes, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/2ce4c1d37618b85fb4af3964dd1e87ded5013de4"&gt;the full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we need to mention another thing. As many other open-source projects, we don’t have any clear idea how much our software is actually used. There is a huge discrepancy between the number of downloads (about 50,000 currently for the latest release) and the number of online players (60-75 players concurrently at peak times). In order to get a better idea of this, and also to help with steering the future direction of the project, we decided to add an anonymous, opt-out data gathering facility to OpenRA. When enabled, the game will send us your operating system and .NET framework version, supported OpenGL version of your graphics card, your language settings, as well as the current mod. As already mentioned, this data is sent to us anonymously, using a randomly generated ID. If you are still feeling uncomfortable with this, you can disable this functionality by unchecking the “Send System Information” checkbox in the advanced settings dialog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20160403-d2k-adv-settings.png" alt="Advanced settings dialog" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
With the help of the data gathered, we hope to be able to decide &amp;ndash; amongst other things &amp;ndash; when we can allow ourselves to drop Windows XP support, and also how much benefit there would be if OpenRA was translated to other languages, and if so, which languages should be prioritized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the installer for your operating system &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;on our download page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much, and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
