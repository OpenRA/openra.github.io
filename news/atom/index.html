    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
Halloween is upon us, and the latest OpenRA playtest is full of new tricks and other treats!
This build includes all of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/41b6f77d2b8c7307d5576e5521caeb25a0c2d476"&gt;major new features and balance changes&lt;/a&gt; that we have planned for our Christmas release, and it is going to be one of our biggest releases yet!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We rely on your testing and feedback to make sure that our release builds are as balanced and bug-free as possible, so please let us know if you find any issues or just generally don’t like something by &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;filing a bug&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;joining our IRC channel&lt;/a&gt;!  We will try our best to fix any
issues before the final release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grab the installer now for your operating system from our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ten-reasons-to-try-the-new-openra-playtest"&gt;Ten reasons to try the new OpenRA Playtest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-chat-lobby"&gt;1. New chat lobby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-multiplayer.png" alt="Global chat lobby" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The multiplayer server browser and game lobby have been redesigned around a new global
chat channel.&lt;br /&gt;This will make it easier to find and talk with other players, and to organize matches without server-hopping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The channel is available from outside the game as well, by connecting to
irc.openra.net:6667 channel #lobby using your favourite IRC client.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="game-speed-options"&gt;2. Game speed options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-gamespeed.png" alt="Game speed control" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Do you think that our default game speed is too slow (or too fast)?  We now include a game speed option in the lobby and campaign menus!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="overhauled-dune-2000-mod"&gt;3. Overhauled Dune 2000 mod&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-d2k.png" alt="Dune 2000" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding:10px; margin:10px;"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;
A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of our big focuses has been completely overhauling our Dune 2000 mod to more closely match the
original game.  All of the unit and building statistics have been adjusted, and we have implemented
new (old) features including the thumper and spice blows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have made good progress towards matching the feel of the original game, but we aren't there yet.
Let us know what you think, or if you find something that still doesn't match!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="tiberian-dawn-mod-improvements"&gt;4. Tiberian Dawn mod improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-td.gif" alt="Commando mission" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Tiberian Dawn mod includes some incremental balance changes plus a bug fix for SAM Sites that would refuse to close.   We have included several new multiplayer maps, and two new campaign missions &amp;mdash; including a stormy commando mission.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="red-alert-mod-improvements"&gt;5. Red Alert mod improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-ra.png" alt="Yak Attack" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Red Alert mod finally received a much needed shock-trooper nerf, and a fix for destroyed aircraft taking far too long to crash to the ground.  The Soviet Hijacker and France's fake structures have also been improved, and we include five(!) new campaign missions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="joystick-scrolling"&gt;6. Joystick scrolling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-scrolling.png" alt="Joystick scrolling" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another commonly requested feature was the ability to scroll using the right mouse button like a
joystick (like TS and RA2).  You can now enable "Joystick" scrolling in the Input tab of the Settings dialog.  We are still hard at work on our Tiberian Sun mod, but we still don't have a release date for you yet!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="units-defend-by-default"&gt;7. Units “defend” by default&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-tddefend.png" alt="Attack force" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Players have often complained about their units chasing the enemy across the map, and our "pro"
players know that it is best to change the stance of their units to the "defend" mode.  We have
made this the new default for all units, streamlining the game play a little bit for everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you want to change your units back to the old "attack anything" mode, you can use the change
stance hotkey (ctrl+z by default).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="new-asset-installer"&gt;8. New asset installer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-installer.png" alt="Asset installer" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have consolidated our asset installation procedure into the mod chooser.  Look out for even more
improvements in future releases!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fixes-and-performance"&gt;9. Fixes and performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-fixes.png" alt="Goodbye crashes!" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have fixed a large number of bugs, including the well-known replay freeze bug when a player
disconnects, and a memory corruption bug that would cause random crashes when starting a match on a
Windows OS.  We have continued our crusade for performance, and this playtest shows significant
further improvements over the last release.

&lt;!-- div style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding:10px; margin:10px;"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;
23:21 &lt;+pchote&gt; RoosterDragon: do you have numbers for how much better this playtest should be?&lt;br /&gt;
23:21 &lt; RoosterDragon&gt; a metric buttload&lt;br /&gt;
23:21 &lt; RoosterDragon&gt; you can quote me on that
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash; from the openra IRC channel
&lt;/div --&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id="improved-map-and-mod-support"&gt;10. Improved map and mod support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20151031-modders.png" alt="Mod support" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is a boatload of new features for modders and map authors: maps can now include custom music
and define particle effects for rain, snow, or sand storms.  We have made major changes to the
traits that control actor rendering and targeting that make them more flexible and self-consistent.
Make sure to use the automatic rule upgrader to easily port your maps and mods to the new release!
You will need to manually update your mod.yaml and UI definitions for the new version.

LANDCOM 16 HQS.
TOP SECRET
TO: ALL FIELD COMMANDERS

AN INTERCEPTED COMMUNIQUE INDICATES THE IMMEDIATE AVAILABILITY OF A
NEW SEPTEMBER 2015 OPENRA RELEASE.  SUBSEQUENT INTERROGATION OF THE

CHANGES TOWARDS THEIR WAR EFFORT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS.  A LARGE

AND DESTROY ALL ENEMY OPPOSITION.

TRANSMISSION ENDS.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our latest release includes changes and new features that implement several popular requests, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for installing assets from an English “The First Decade” DVD.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding the ability to view the map after a match completes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding a notification when a game admin selects a map with custom rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recording replays for single player missions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removing the “Enemy Detected” warnings from RA and D2K.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixing bottlenecks in the AI and harvesters to dramatically improve late-game performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completely overhauled in-game music behaviour (don’t forget to install the music from Extras → Music!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture screenshots (saved to the support directory) using Ctrl/Cmd+P.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units will no longer pursue enemies after they disappear under the fog of war.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved aircraft and paradrop behaviour in RA.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added missions Atreides01a and Atreides01b and FMV installation to D2K.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this is only a small sampling of the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; that is available on our wiki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer now for your operating system from our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;
Once again we hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that many people are excited about our in-development Tiberian Sun mod, and we’re pleased to report that we have made significant progress during this release cycle.  The core engine changes to support the 2.5D isometric maps used by TS and RA2 are now complete, and we are making slow-but-forward progress on implementing the many missing gameplay features for TS.  There is still a lot of work to go, so we do not have a formal release schedule for these mods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150919-ra-spy.png" alt="New spy abilities" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The spy in Red Alert has gained the ability to detect enemy spies and&lt;br /&gt;infiltrate enemy production buildings to unlock veteran unit production.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150919-returntomap.png" alt="Return to map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is once again possible to view the map after a mission or match is complete.&lt;br /&gt;It is now also possible to view replays of campaign missions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150919-d2k-repairs.png" alt="Carryall transports" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Use the repair cursor to order damaged vehicles back to a service depot.&lt;br /&gt;In D2K an idle carryall will give it a quick lift!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another playtest on the road to our next stable release is ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in a feature freeze, we focused on fixing bugs and inconsistencies reported by community members to ensure the release is as bug-free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More notable things that got fixed include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An exploit where spies in RA could infiltrate team mate’s structures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues with crushing infantry and walls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues with units entering transports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual errors connected to shroud and fog of war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Historical-Changelogs"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer for this playtest &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;from our download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150830-new-ra-production-overlays.png" alt="Custom map rule warning" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The spy production veterancy overlay has been improved to better fit the RA icon style.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20150808/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the second playtest on the road to our next stable release.  We have now entered the feature freeze phase, which means that we have stopped adding new features and instead focus on fixing any bugs that you might find.  That means that we need your help with testing, testing, and some more testing!  Please report any bugs or problems you encounter &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for helping to improve OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of new features, fixes, and performance improvements make this a significant improvement over the last playtest and the June release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce that we have finally addressed a few long-standing performance issues that caused significant lag spikes in the mid to late game.  As part of this work, the AI has become a lot smarter about base building, uses support powers more reliably, and harvesters are less likely to become stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music playback has received quite a lot of changes.  Map authors now have much greater control over music, including the ability to specify default (starting) music as well as custom victory and defeat tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spies in the Red Alert mod have received a major overhaul, making them much more useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paratroopers can now be selected and given orders before they land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two new single-player missions have been added, Soviets 04a and 04b.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Single-player missions have been polished, and Allies 05 has received a new ultra-hard difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mission replays can again be viewed through the replay browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A warning message is now given when a server admin selects a map with custom rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Range circles are now visible to allied players and spectators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Players can now hide the in-game UI (using a hotkey, bound to Ctrl+Shift+H by default).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We now support installing game content from &lt;em&gt;The First Decade&lt;/em&gt; DVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of interest for modders and mappers will be the addition of new Lua API functions.  Disguising spies, capturing or infiltrating units and buildings using scripting is now possible.  Other newly available functions can be used to play arbitrary sound files, flash the screen, and control the new palette effect trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we did not only add new things, but also fixed bugs and annoyances.  Here’s a small sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A number of crashes have been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The score screen can now be closed to have a look at the battlefield after the match.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘Options’ button will no longer blink without reason in skirmish maps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The duration bar on chronoshifted units in the Red Alert mod is no longer visible to enemy players.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The aircraft and helicopter cruise altitude in the Red Alert mod has been increased again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The unit duplication crate bonus has been removed from the Tiberian Dawn mod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the gritty details check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Historical-Changelogs"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer for this playtest &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;from our download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-cnc-lobby.png" alt="Custom map rule warning" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The game will warn players in the lobby when the host selects a map with custom rules.  This should help combat the small number of dishonest players who adjusted rules to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-ra-infiltrate-production-bonus.png" alt="Veteran unit production after infiltration" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Infiltrating an enemy production building with a spy will let you build veteran units.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-d2k-range-circles.png" alt="Observer range circles and hidden gui" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allied players and spectators can now see the range circles from units and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="600" height="333" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ai-MeYDx5c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New Lua API functions can be used to simulate simple weather effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="600" height="333" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WoZoQILTaGk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Work continues on our Tiberian Sun mod which still isn’t ready for release.  Check out these clips from a recorded developer test game!&lt;/p&gt;
