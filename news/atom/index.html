    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another playtest on the road to our next stable release is ready!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in a feature freeze, we focused on fixing bugs and inconsistencies reported by community members to ensure the release is as bug-free as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More notable things that got fixed include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An exploit where spies in RA could infiltrate team mate’s structures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues with crushing infantry and walls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Issues with units entering transports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visual errors connected to shroud and fog of war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For details check out the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer for this playtest &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;from our download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150830-new-ra-production-overlays.png" alt="Custom map rule warning" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The spy production veterancy overlay has been improved to better fit the RA icon style.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce the second playtest on the road to our next stable release.  We have now entered the feature freeze phase, which means that we have stopped adding new features and instead focus on fixing any bugs that you might find.  That means that we need your help with testing, testing, and some more testing!  Please report any bugs or problems you encounter &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for helping to improve OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of new features, fixes, and performance improvements make this a significant improvement over the last playtest and the June release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce that we have finally addressed a few long-standing performance issues that caused significant lag spikes in the mid to late game.  As part of this work, the AI has become a lot smarter about base building, uses support powers more reliably, and harvesters are less likely to become stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music playback has received quite a lot of changes.  Map authors now have much greater control over music, including the ability to specify default (starting) music as well as custom victory and defeat tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spies in the Red Alert mod have received a major overhaul, making them much more useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paratroopers can now be selected and given orders before they land.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two new single-player missions have been added, Soviets 04a and 04b.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Single-player missions have been polished, and Allies 05 has received a new ultra-hard difficulty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mission replays can again be viewed through the replay browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A warning message is now given when a server admin selects a map with custom rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Range circles are now visible to allied players and spectators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Players can now hide the in-game UI (using a hotkey, bound to Ctrl+Shift+H by default).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We now support installing game content from &lt;em&gt;The First Decade&lt;/em&gt; DVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of interest for modders and mappers will be the addition of new Lua API functions.  Disguising spies, capturing or infiltrating units and buildings using scripting is now possible.  Other newly available functions can be used to play arbitrary sound files, flash the screen, and control the new palette effect trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we did not only add new things, but also fixed bugs and annoyances.  Here’s a small sample:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A number of crashes have been resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The score screen can now be closed to have a look at the battlefield after the match.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ‘Options’ button will no longer blink without reason in skirmish maps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The duration bar on chronoshifted units in the Red Alert mod is no longer visible to enemy players.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The aircraft and helicopter cruise altitude in the Red Alert mod has been increased again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The unit duplication crate bonus has been removed from the Tiberian Dawn mod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the gritty details check out the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer for this playtest &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;from our download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-cnc-lobby.png" alt="Custom map rule warning" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The game will warn players in the lobby when the host selects a map with custom rules.  This should help combat the small number of dishonest players who adjusted rules to their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-ra-infiltrate-production-bonus.png" alt="Veteran unit production after infiltration" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Infiltrating an enemy production building with a spy will let you build veteran units.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150808-d2k-range-circles.png" alt="Observer range circles and hidden gui" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Allied players and spectators can now see the range circles from units and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="600" height="333" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ai-MeYDx5c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;New Lua API functions can be used to simulate simple weather effects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe width="600" height="333" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WoZoQILTaGk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Work continues on our Tiberian Sun mod which still isn’t ready for release.  Check out these clips from a recorded developer test game!&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20150628/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Work has been progressing well on our next development cycle, and we are today making a snapshot of this work available in the form of a new playtest release.  &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20150628&lt;/a&gt; focuses on behind-the-scenes improvements, but also includes a collection of new features and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible changes in this playtest include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Removed the “Enemy unit detected” notification, by popular demand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of TD balance changes based on player feedback. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8303"&gt;#8303&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the repair cursor or order a unit to a repair depot.  In D2K a carryall will pick up the actor. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8056"&gt;#8056&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units built from the starport in D2K now work with the “select units by type” hotkey. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8212"&gt;#8212&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to the player name and color validation. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8137"&gt;#8137&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8380"&gt;#8380&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New missions: Nod06b, Nod06c (TD), Soviet02a, Soviet05 (RA), Atreides01a, Atreides01b (D2K).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of polish fixes for maps, tooltips, and unit artwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the technical front, improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of fixes for issues found using &lt;a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3650"&gt;Coverity Scan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several new lint tests to detect common YAML errors in maps and mods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes towards a more consistent set of rendering traits. [&lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/8171/"&gt;#8171&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Significant rework of the shroud code to prepare for TS shroud and scripted map area changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved support for compiling and running OpenRA on BSD operating systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Lua-API-(playtest)"&gt;Lua API&lt;/a&gt; for map authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the full changelog, please refer to &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog"&gt;the changelog page on our wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new in-game map editor has also received a collection of bug fixes, and the ability to view and edit the area outside the playable map area.  The old map editor (which we inadvertently broke in the last release - sorry!) has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any problems or bugs  (especially anything related to the shroud or any new crashes), then please let us know &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt; or the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-ra-soviet05-screenshot-showcase.png" alt="Red Alert Soviet05 screenshot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Press &lt;code&gt;CTRL&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; to take a screenshot. The hotkey binding is configuarable via Settings - Input.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-carryall-repair.gif" alt="Carryall repair delivery" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Use the repair cursor in D2K to signal a Carryall to transport an actor for repair!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-editor.png" alt="New map editor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new map editor is more stable, and updated maps now show correctly in the map selection screen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150628-ts-shroud.png" alt="TS Shroud" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A preview of things to come: work is nearly complete on rewriting the shroud logic to support terrain height.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Release 20150614</title>
    <published>2015-06-14T10:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2015-06-14T10:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/release-20150614/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce the June 2015 release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, it was our goal to reduce the length of this development cycle, and we succeeded! With about 22500 changed lines in just over 300 commits by a total of 25 developers since the last release, the list of new features is naturally a bit shorter than last time around, but it contains some good ones!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standout feature of this release is of course the long-awaited in-game map editor. For the first time ever, we are offering a map editing ability for all our mods, on all supported operating systems. You can access the map editor from the “Extras” sub-menu of the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new map editor offers the following benefits and features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully cross-platform, just like the game itself. Finally, a map editor for OS X!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Truly WYSIWYG. It uses the game renderer, so there are no more rendering glitches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for all mods. The legacy editor did not support Dune 2000 properly, and Tiberian Sun not at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the legacy editor, there is not yet full feature parity: the in-game editor is missing cut-and-paste operations, a display of the sum of resources on the map, and also does not show the coordinates of cells. These short-comings will be rectified in future releases. Meanwhile, they remain available in the legacy editor, which is still being shipped with this release. It will, however, be removed in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complementing the new editor is an improved map chooser dialog, which now separates official and custom maps. It also allows deleting one or all of your custom maps. We also took this chance to add the often-requested ability for all players to view the map chooser from the game lobby (but changing the map still remains the prerogative of the host).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new feature with a lot of potential is the added operating system integration of OpenRA. The installers will associate the game with OpenRA replay files and OpenRA server URLs. These will allow websites hosting replay archives to add one-click watching of replays, and creating alternative server browsers. As an example, our own &lt;a href="/games/"&gt;web-based server browser&lt;/a&gt; has been enhanced to offer clickable links to waiting games that will automatically start OpenRA and connect you to the server. You can also create bookmarks to your favourite OpenRA servers on your desktop! These associations are available on all supported operating systems as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other minor additions include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Dune 2000 mod has gained building upgrades, and now matches the original game’s tech tree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A total of six single-player missions have been added to the Tiberian Dawn mod. Enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The “Team health colors” option now provides a better distinction between your own and allied units.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support powers can now be activated using configurable hotkeys.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A “quick placement” mode has been added which will automatically pick up a completed building for placement when the player selects the corresponding production tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from new features, the usual number of bug fixes has found its way into the code. Among them is a fix for a high-profile bug that caused the inability to undeploy construction yards. Several graphical problems, from glitches in the menus to occasionally missing mouse cursors have been resolved as well as issues in our single-player mission scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for all the gory details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;! We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-ra-mapeditor.png" alt="Ingame map editor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new map editor was almost 18 months in the making!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-web-server-browser.png" alt="Web-based server browser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The added operating system integration allows connecting to games from links on websites or bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-cnc-missions.png" alt="New single-player missions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The work on our single-player campaigns &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net/4988"&gt;is progressing nicely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;The Nod campaign is now almost half done!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150614-d2k-building-upgrades.png" alt="D2k building upgrades" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Building upgrades have been added to our Dune 2000 mod,&lt;br /&gt;which now allow us to almost match the original game’s tech tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
