    <title type="html">Upcoming features for the summer release</title>
    <published>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/preview-20190606/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been quite a while since our last release, but not to worry, we are still going - mostly rewriting tons of code not visible to the outside eye. While not presenting a full playtest we want to take the time to introduce the community to some upcoming changes to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="singleplayer-savegames"&gt;Singleplayer savegames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most wanted missing feature, the next version will include support for savegames in both skirmish and the campaigns. No more losing all progress to a stray dog eating your Tanya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Longer missions can now be played in several takes instead of needing you to pull through in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spectator-ui-and-new-tiberian-dawn-sidebar"&gt;Spectator UI and new Tiberian Dawn sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spectator UI has always been noted to be clunky and take too much space on the screen. With the next update we are happy to finally introduce a more slim and focused spectator UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-spectator-UI.png" alt="A new spectator UI." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new transpart overlay is a huge quality of live upgrade for both casters and casual spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second most visible update features yet another long standing UI rework that was just completed last month after sitting on the shelf for years. The sidebar in Tiberian Dawn was completely overhauled and looks better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-building-placement-previews"&gt;Polished building placement previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much to say here, the images will tell the story. The tweaked placement preview makes it easier to see both the building being placed and any cells that are blocked by units or debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side node for the modders reading this: With the coming update the core engine will also support placing building variants in your mod (if you like north and south facing refineries for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new Tiberian Dawn UI includes a refreshed building placement overlay and brand new sidebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-map-previews"&gt;Polished map previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingame UI was not the only thing getting an upgrade. We overhauled the map previews of the map chooser to look the same as ingame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-map-previews.gif" alt="Overhauled map previews." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new previews include the positions of forests and civilian structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="setting-support-power-directions"&gt;Setting support power directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parabombs and airstrikes have long been a point of both frustration (when taking too long to reach their destination) and joy (when immediately whipping an army at the map edge). We kept the joy aspect, but removed the frustration! The upcoming release will allow you to conveniently select the approach vector by dragging into a specific direction while placing the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-directional-powers.gif" alt="Directional powers." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Want to avoid air defenses by sending your troopers in from the south? We’ve got your back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="even-more-upcoming-changes"&gt;Even more upcoming changes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list is long, too long for this post. A few other noteworthy changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new time limit lobby option for multiplayer and skirmish games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many fixes for queued unit orders, aircraft, and harvesters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removed Mono requirement on macOS and Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new name and artwork for the long-controversial Allied Hind in Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many new tweaks and traits for modders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even more bug and performance improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take a peek at our &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog-(bleed)/5ad4377a7ba21abc017d6c0367750d0ea279d4b0"&gt;development changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested in the entire list of upcoming changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Release 20190314</title>
    <published>2019-03-14T20:30:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-03-14T20:30:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/release-20190314/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Release 20190314&lt;/a&gt;, which brings changes developed between August 2018 and January 2019 and polished with the help of player feedback &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190302/"&gt;playtests&lt;/a&gt; during the last 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting change in this release comes from a complete overhaul of the unit targeting logic, which fixes many long-standing bugs and introduces some important improvements to gameplay fluidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic targeting now properly accounts for the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker has been promoted to thief, who can steal cash from refineries as well as vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, Red Alert now features an additional seven single-player missions, and Tiberian Dawn another two. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alert &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Balance changes&lt;/a&gt; include adjustments to the long-controversial Allied Artillery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the map editor, including a map actor editor, a new Copy/Paste filter, and the ability to select multiple terrain categories in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more minor changes and bugfixes, so take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to unwrap all of the details. Grab the installer now for your operating system from &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;our download page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses a number of issues discovered in playtest-20190209.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The changes in &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190302&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed target cursor issues with buildings under the fog&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed inconsistent “Unit Ready” audio notifications&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed harvesters moving to empty resource fields when unloading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed turrets “twitching” when targeting enemies at their maximum range&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed a collection of map and mission issues in Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Implemented community-driven &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/263d8e2b66e6292dfd798cbe369a7cc5befe4c1d#ra-balance-changes-20190302"&gt;balance changes&lt;/a&gt; for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We expect this to be our final release candidate, which will be repackaged as a new release before the end of March if no further regressions are found.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20180209 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;new playtest build&lt;/a&gt; is now available with a collection of fixes and improvements over &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last playtest made some big changes to how targeting interacts with the Fog of War, which broke a lot more than we expected. Rather than reverting these changes, we decided to go all-in, and replaced even more of the targeting code - a job that we had originally planned for the release after next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new changes should fix not just the regressions in the last playtest, but also several other long-standing gameplay bugs and inconsistencies with the Fog of War, engineers, and aircraft. They also bring two long-requested features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new features, which should go a long way towards improving combat fluidness and the ability to micromanage your forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio notification changes introduced in the last playtest have been refined and expanded by adding click feedback to the sidebar, reducing the volume of the “cash tick” sounds, and normalizing the volume changes between different music tracks. The build is rounded out with fixes for bugs and crashes that were reported in the first playtest — see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/7b4a50814a012c161e68378f7af533e6c2dfd5f7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;playtest-20190106&lt;/a&gt; news post for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to give it a try, and let us know what you think in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also back into competitive scene, with Red Alert Global League running its seventh season in March and April. New signups are possible until February 27th; check &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=20868"&gt;the registrations thread&lt;/a&gt; for the relevant information on how you can participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tournament will build up on the structure changes made in the previous season, but coming engine modifications and improvements are sure to stir things up among the competition. We are also to see whether Barf will be able to break the RAGL tradition and become the first triple champion or this continues further with a new player crowned at the end. As usual, there will be an aim to achieve at any tier, with several spots providing monetary prizes from a publicly collected prize pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit our &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=20869"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; to read all about the tournament and join our &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord server&lt;/a&gt; to stay informed on all the day-to-day activities in the community, as well as to discuss games, provide feedback and share your ideas on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190106/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Better late than never, OpenRA is celebrating the new year with our planned “2018 holiday-season” playtest. &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Playtest 20190106&lt;/a&gt; brings some big changes to gameplay mechanics, more single-player content, and even more bug fixes and performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change comes to the unit targeting logic, which has been reworked to better understand the Fog of War. This has fixed a collection of long-standing bugs (especially with artillery-style units), however, due to the subtle nature of these changes, more testing is required to predict the impact on overall gameplay and game balance. We hope that the community can rally behind testing and report any issues so that they can be addressed before the final release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker is now the Thief, who can steal cash from refineries in addition to capturing vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, seven new single-player missions have been ported from the original Red Alert, and another two from Tiberian Dawn. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the development tools. The map editor has been upgraded with a new actor property editor and improved copy/paste tool, and the tile selection sidebar now supports multi-category selections. The mod rule linter has been made more robust, and can now report errors in audio notifications. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20190106"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; has also been updated to work with the new playtest and planned future changes to the &lt;a href="https://resource.openra.net/"&gt;OpenRA Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenRA is developed by volunteers who freely donate their spare time to build games that everybody can enjoy. Playtest 20190106 contains changes from 34 contributors over the last 5 months, and fixes bugs reported by many others. This post covers only some of the changes, so see the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/8da02c00e84314555e0f2436b3cf1627f262426d"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playtest releases are our way of crowdsourcing bug reports and feedback so that the next release can be the best it possibly can. This only works if you get involved, play games, and report your feedback. If you do have something to say, please let us know in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/UcUztfr"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtest releases do not overwrite the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server. Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
