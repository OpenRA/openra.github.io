&lt;div style="margin: -10px 5px"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are today pushing a new build that addresses several issues discovered in the previous playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/b86b6d003747ce23f955c9ce5ea578cdac993546"&gt;changes in playtest-20191102&lt;/a&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed infantry failing to dodge crushes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed pilots ejected from killed aircraft remaining in the air&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Restored ability to force-move helicopters above enemy buildings&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several long-standing issues with classic (left-click) mouse controls&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed 64-bit installation directory on Windows&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We are now aiming for a late November stable release, which gives approximately two weeks for any final issues to be discovered with this playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to grab the new playtest, and prepare for battle!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20191021/"&gt;original announcement&lt;/a&gt; for playtest-20191021 is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new playtest is now available for OpenRA’s increasingly poorly named “Summer 2019” release. Thanks to everybody who tested the last playtest, this build should address all the issues and feedback that have been reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key changes in playtest-20191021 from the previous &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190825"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several issues with game loading/saving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several crashes and a desync issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several glitches related to unit movement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several mission related issues in Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixes for several compatibility issues with Linux and FreeBSD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refinements to the new spectator UI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further Red Alert balance adjustments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this will be the last playtest build, and if no further issues are found we expect a new release version in a few weeks time.
Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt;, try it out, and let us know if you find any issues or have any other feedback before it is too late!
As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/e9727bc4e669cdbd5d5b3bfa1e26946d2c4708c7"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available on GitHub if you would like to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Season 8 of the Red Alert Global League is well underway. Resident RAGL wrangler netnazgul has been posting weekly wrap-up reports on the forum (&lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21029"&gt;Week 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21031"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt;), covering the highlights and providing links to stream VODs for everybody who would like to keep up with the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-ragl.gif" alt="Explosive RAGL action" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;RAGL Season 8 has been packed with explosive action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been relatively quiet about OpenRA’s Tiberian Sun mod lately, but this does not mean it has been abandoned. Development has been focused mainly on resolving low-level game engine issues, which has been slow due to the complexity of the work involved and relative lack of manpower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples of this work can be seen in &lt;a href="/news/release-20180923/"&gt;release-20180923&lt;/a&gt; which included renderer changes that roughly doubled TS’s in-game performance, in &lt;a href="/news/release-20190314"&gt;release-20190314&lt;/a&gt; which fixed a collection of game-breaking bugs with Nod’s cloak generator technology, and in the upcoming release which significantly improves deployable units and aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployable units were a big part of Tiberian Sun, with several combat units, support units, and even production facilities (in the Firestorm expansion) all having the ability to switch between mobile and stationary modes. OpenRA’s unit-deploy code was originally written for the classic Construction Yards, and was poorly suited for the more dynamic gameplay cases used in Tiberian Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code has been overhauled to add missing features and additional quality of life improvements. Deploy commands can now be queued between other orders (great for managing transports!), and deployed units can be ordered to undeploy and move to another location (including into a transport, or onto a service depot) as a single action. The risk of accidentally packing your Construction Yard with a misclick has been reduced by requiring the force-move hotkey to be held while issuing these orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20191021-tibsun.png" alt="Tiberian Sun update" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft and deployable units work much better in the under-development Tiberian Sun mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code defining aircraft and helicopter movement has also been rewritten, implementing many of the flight dynamics needed for Banshees, Orcas, and Carryalls. The Carryall’s transport behavior has also been refined, with unit pick-up behaving much like the original game, but unit unloading now requiring an explicit order like other transports. This makes it possible to queue multiple transport runs, or to land the Carryall without releasing its cargo. Carryalls can now also be ordered to pick up deployed units, which will undeploy for pickup once the Carryall arrives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are slowly working through our list of must-have features for a public release, but there are still many more to go. We still cannot predict a release date, but the Tiberian Sun mod is developed in the open on &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (like everything else in OpenRA) so everybody is welcome to follow the progress and participate in this work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Playtest 20190825</title>
    <published>2019-08-25T12:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-08-25T12:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20190825/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled and relieved to finally announce the first public playtest for OpenRA’s second 2019 release. This playtest brings significant technical changes, so we felt it important to delay the “summer” release until we could be confident that the worst bugs and gameplay regressions had been fixed. With some help from our &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;Forum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; community, we are now ready to release &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;playtest-20190825&lt;/a&gt; for wider testing and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/preview-20190606/"&gt;Summer Release Preview&lt;/a&gt; article outlined several of the new UI features, including &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;savegame support&lt;/span&gt;, a new &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;spectator UI&lt;/span&gt;, and a long planned &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;Tiberian Dawn interface overhaul&lt;/span&gt;. This playtest adds a much improved &lt;span style="color: #d92c2c"&gt;hotkey configuration UI&lt;/span&gt; and many smaller UI fixes and polish improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The Tiberian Dawn in-game interface has received a long-awaited redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Missions and skirmish games can be saved and restarted later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the gameplay front, the main focus for this release was to rewrite the logic that controls how units behave and respond to orders. This was a major task that spanned several months, more than 90 Pull Requests, and more than one debate about bug vs “accidental feature”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the changes will not be immediately obvious, but on closer inspection you should find that many long-standing quirks and annoyances in unit behaviour no longer occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to queue commands using the Shift key has always been an important part of OpenRA’s gameplay, and this has received a major overhaul with this release. Part of the overhaul has moved the familiar targeting lines that display when you command units into the “Waypoint Mode” (Shift) overlay by default. The previous behaviour can be restored through the Settings menu (Target Lines: Automatic) if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190825-waypoint.png" alt="Waypoint mode." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The improved waypoint mode allows you to plan your attack strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other noteable changes to watch out for include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force Move (Alt) can be used to undeploy Construction Yards and land helicopters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft respond to Scatter orders from the Command Bar (Ctrl + X)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significantly improved behaviour for harvesters, aircraft, attack-move, and unit repair&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given an attack direction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The controversial Allied Hind helicopter in RA has been replaced with the Black Hawk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two new-to-OpenRA missions from the RA Counterstrike expansion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The D2k Death Hand missile now works like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A collection of &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Red Alert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6#td-balance-changes"&gt;Tiberian Dawn&lt;/a&gt; balance changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/4e8c55f0a17caee09f0833a3fbf9fc0861b982f6"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; is available with more information on the changes and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-directional-powers.gif" alt="Directional powers." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Aircraft-based support powers can be given a direction by dragging the mouse while targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a .NET application, OpenRA relies on the Mono runtime for our Linux and macOS players. Unfortunately, the Mono packages provided by some major LTS distros are several years out of date and incompatible with the modern .NET standard. Worse, the new Debian Buster and Ubuntu 19.04 releases shipped with a serious Mono bug that causes unavoidable crashes OpenRA and other .NET applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution for these issues is to package the parts of Mono that OpenRA requires inside the AppImage and macOS app releases. This means that you can finally play OpenRA without having to install any system-level dependencies. For players or packagers who prefer to compile OpenRA from source, Mono 5.4 or later and msbuild are now required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating our base requirements has allowed several further improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows releases are now 64 bit by default (32 bit releases remain available)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A fix for the macOS black-screen startup freeze after Mono or macOS upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Future support for the .NET Core runtime (this work is still in progress)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved development tooling and IDE support for OpenRA and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK"&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playtest releases do not overwrite the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server. Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; and give it a try! This is your time to get involved, play games, and let us know what you think! If you discover a bug or have any other feedback, please let us know in the comments below, on &lt;a href="https://forum.openra.net"&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://discord.openra.net"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Upcoming features for the summer release</title>
    <published>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2019-06-06T04:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="https://www.openra.net/news/preview-20190606/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been quite a while since our last release, but not to worry, we are still going - mostly rewriting tons of code not visible to the outside eye. While not presenting a full playtest we want to take the time to introduce the community to some upcoming changes to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="singleplayer-savegames"&gt;Singleplayer savegames&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most wanted missing feature, the next version will include support for savegames in both skirmish and the campaigns. No more losing all progress to a stray dog eating your Tanya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-savegame-d2k.png" alt="The savegame load screen in D2k." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Longer missions can now be played in several takes instead of needing you to pull through in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="spectator-ui-and-new-tiberian-dawn-sidebar"&gt;Spectator UI and new Tiberian Dawn sidebar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spectator UI has always been noted to be clunky and take too much space on the screen. With the next update we are happy to finally introduce a more slim and focused spectator UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-spectator-UI.png" alt="A new spectator UI." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new transparent overlay is a huge quality of live upgrade for both casters and casual spectators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our second most visible update features yet another long standing UI rework that was just completed last month after sitting on the shelf for years. The sidebar in Tiberian Dawn was completely overhauled and looks better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-building-placement-previews"&gt;Polished building placement previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not much to say here, the images will tell the story. The tweaked placement preview in RA, TD, and D2k makes it easier to see both the building being placed and any cells that are blocked by units or debris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a side node for the modders reading this: With the coming update the core engine will also support placing building variants in your mod (if you like north and south facing refineries for example).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-td-sidebar.gif" alt="The new Tiberian Dawn sidebar." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new Tiberian Dawn UI includes a refreshed building placement overlay and brand new sidebars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="polished-map-previews"&gt;Polished map previews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingame UI was not the only thing getting an upgrade. We overhauled the map previews of the map chooser to look the same as ingame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-map-previews.gif" alt="Overhauled map previews." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The new previews include the positions of forests and civilian structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="setting-support-power-directions"&gt;Setting support power directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parabombs and airstrikes have long been a point of both frustration (when taking too long to reach their destination) and joy (when immediately wiping out an army at the map edge). We kept the joy aspect, but removed the frustration! The upcoming release will allow you to conveniently select the approach vector by dragging into a specific direction while placing the power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190606-directional-powers.gif" alt="Directional powers." width="600px" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Want to avoid air defenses by sending your troopers in from the south? We’ve got your back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;Release 20190314&lt;/a&gt;, which brings changes developed between August 2018 and January 2019 and polished with the help of player feedback &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190106/"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190209/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/news/playtest-20190302/"&gt;playtests&lt;/a&gt; during the last 10 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting change in this release comes from a complete overhaul of the unit targeting logic, which fixes many long-standing bugs and introduces some important improvements to gameplay fluidity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tanks and other turreted units automatically target nearby units while moving&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic targeting now properly accounts for the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Force-firing with long-range artillery style units targets the ground, allowing attacks to continue when vision is lost under the Fog of War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190209-opportunityfire.gif" alt="Tanks targeting while moving" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tanks now automatically target enemy forces while moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specialised infantry in Red Alert have had a shake-down and a fix-up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Engineers are now consumed when capturing buildings, after a short external wait&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hijacker has been promoted to thief, who can steal cash from refineries as well as vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allied Mechanics now repair destroyed team-mate vehicles instead of capturing them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Attack Dog behaviour resolves many issues and behaves more like the original game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-dog-attack.gif" width="600" alt="Thieves and Attack Dogs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Improvements to the Attack Dog and Thief should make them more viable on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the hard work of several new contributors, Red Alert now features an additional seven single-player missions, and Tiberian Dawn another two. Behind the scenes, the underlying AI framework has been rewritten to support the development of some long-planned improvements in future releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other notable gameplay changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Units in the &lt;em&gt;Return Fire&lt;/em&gt; stance will no longer chase their attackers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Infantry in Pillboxes in Red Alert no longer gain experience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alert &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c#ra-balance-changes"&gt;Balance changes&lt;/a&gt; include adjustments to the long-controversial Allied Artillery&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new Ctrl modifier queues items at the front of the production queue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The spectator UI now includes information on player army values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-missions-2x.png" width="600" alt="TD Campaign Mission: Nod 10b" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Nine more single-player missions have been adapted from the original games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release brings several improvements to the map editor, including a map actor editor, a new Copy/Paste filter, and the ability to select multiple terrain categories in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20190106-editor-2x.png" width="600" alt="Map Editor Improvements Profiles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The map editor now supports editing actor properties such as owner, health, facing, and stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more minor changes and bugfixes, so take a look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/80d63d9768e3b8a3fc2ce742fa8cd0184cab587c"&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; if you want to unwrap all of the details.
