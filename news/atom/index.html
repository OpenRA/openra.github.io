    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very pleased to announce the Spring release of OpenRA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release a huge step forward for the Dune 2000 mod in particular. It includes just shy of 1000 commits by 53 contributors, the culmination of six months of relentless work. With more than 2000 files and 210,000 changed lines it is one of our busiest development cycles to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large development focus has been on the Dune 2000 mod, which contains the most visible changes. A new sidebar, sandworms and Carryalls are the big new features, which should make any Dune 2000 player feel more at home in our mod. Additionally, the OpenRA.Utility now supports importing maps from the original Dune 2000 game, so we hope that the number of maps and of course the number of players will increase in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other mods were not neglected, though. In Red Alert, the standout feature is the support of playable factions such as Russia, England, France, Ukraine and Germany. In both Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn, new single-player missions are available that will keep you occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have not only improved the mods themselves. Here is a list of changes that affect the game in general:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The server browser shows and allows joining games from any installed mod.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is now possible to disable the “short game” mode that was forced in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player name and colour can now be set up in the settings dialog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When creating a server, the game informs the host about port forwarding issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Left-click mouse orders have been markedly improved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some missions now support difficulty levels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A huge number of smaller gameplay fixes and improvements, including:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Friendly units blocking the exit of a production building will now move out of the way if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Units will no longer hunt cloaked units.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The spy plane in Red Alert will no longer lure your anti-air capable units across the map.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Planes will no longer collide with helicopters and push them out of the way.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Your faction will not be revealed to enemies when you have selected a random faction in the lobby.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In sell mode, the tooltip will now show the expected refund value for structures.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Harvesters should now no longer block themselves at refineries, and also make use of all available refineries if the nearest ones are occupied.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A similarly massive number of performance improvements have been made in this release.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many race conditions and crashes have been fixed across the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the complete list of changes, please visit &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;our changelog page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on key bindings: In the previous release, the key to toggle team chat was changed to ‘Alt’, which, looking back, was an unfortunate decision. It has been reverted to ‘Tab’ in this release, where it serves a double role: on an empty line, it toggles team chat, otherwise it auto-completes player names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For modders and mappers, there have been quite a few important changes as well. We have introduced a new map format, to which maps running on this release will be updated automatically. All of the shared engine code has been moved into the OpenRA.Mods.Common project, so that third-party mods can drop their dependencies on our game mods. A lot of code has been changed to enable features that will be needed by the Tiberian Sun mod. One important change for Red Alert mappers is that the gem mine has been replaced with a new one. For more details, check out the &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://github.com/openra/openra/wiki/Traits"&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/openra/openra/wiki/Lua-API"&gt;Lua API&lt;/a&gt; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we hope to get the next release out faster than this time around (famous last words!). Feature-wise, you can probably expect the first appearance of the in-game map editor in the next release, in addition to much of the things that are currently in &lt;a href="https://github.com/openra/openra/pulls"&gt;our pull request queue&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we will see… If you want to keep track of the development, keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/milestones/Next%20release"&gt;release milestone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/openra/openra/wiki/Changelog%20(bleed)"&gt;development changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also try to make more use of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRoiPL1J4K1-EhQeNazrYig"&gt;our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; to show off new and little known existing features, provide mission walkthroughs and other content, so watch and subscribe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now enough with the talking! Head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;, grab the installer for your OS, and enjoy the game!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The long awaited sandworms and Carryalls have finally arrived in our Dune 2000 mod!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150424-ra-country-dropdown.png" alt="Playable countries" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Red Alert now has playable country factions, and matching choices for random faction selection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150424-cnc-server-browser.png" alt="Overhauled server browser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The server browser now lists games from all available mods, and also allows joining games across mods.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150424-cnc-mission-difficulty.png" alt="Mission difficulty" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Some missions have received support for multiple difficulty levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150424-ra-refund-tooltip.png" alt="Refund tooltip" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In sell mode, the tooltip will now show a structure’s expected refund value.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/news/20150424-ts-teaser.png" alt="Tiberian Sun teaser" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, the still unreleased, work-in-progress Tiberian Sun mod has received support&lt;br /&gt;for some crucial features. Keep an eye out for more news and media about TS &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/openra"&gt;on our Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" href="http://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20150418/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our plan to release the stable release this weekend has unfortunately been thwarted by a few show-stopper bugs in the last playtest. Those have now all been fixed, so we have decided to do another playtest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the fixes contained in this release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bug in the pathfinder code which caused freezes of several seconds or even longer has been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The minigame and dropzone maps would crash when selected in the lobby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The player’s faction in single-player missions was erroneously assigned at random.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A race condition related to carryalls which caused crashes when met has been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The unintended dependency on XQuartz for the OS X package has been removed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ore silo in Red Alert has been moved to the support structure queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the details can be found on our &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;changelog page&lt;/a&gt; as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head on over to the &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt; to find the installer for your operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really hope that this will be the last playtest in this cycle and we will be able to give you a stable release next weekend. Nonetheless, should you encounter any bugs, problems, or have any suggestions, don’t hesitate to let us know &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on map compatibility: already with the first playtest a new map format was introduced which is not backward-compatible with last October’s release-20141029. This means that if you have downloaded custom maps from &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;the Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere, these maps will have been automatically updated to the new map format once you have run this or one of the previous playtests. If you later go back to the release version, it will not be able to parse the new map format and crash. You can avoid the problem by either deleting the contents of your &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; folder, or by making backups of the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; folder and restoring that when you switch back to release-20141029.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have finalized the balancing for the Red Alert mod, so it’s time for another playtest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes this time around include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More balancing adjustments in Red Alert. Please see &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;the changelog&lt;/a&gt; for a detailed list of changes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed enemies erroneously getting an “(Ally)” suffix in chat messages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Games in progress that are password protected are now indicated as such in the server browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fixed helicopters wasting ammo by trying to shoot at targets directly below them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details and links to pull request can be found on our &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;changelog page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the installers for a variety of supported operating systems in our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will likely be your last chance to give feedback and contribute to this release, so if you find bugs, encounter any problems are have other suggestions, don’t hesitate and report them &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;on our bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have received lots of feedback on our last playtest, for which we are very grateful. Let me take this opportunity to thank all our testers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we have received so much feedback that we felt it was worth it to do another, hopefully last, playtest before the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new playtest addresses most of the issues that have been reported. In particular, these are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The balancing in the Red Alert mod, while not finalized, has received some more touch-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quite a number of crashes and other oddities have been fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The overly enthusiastic “Enemies approaching” warning has been removed from both Red Alert and Dune 2000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even more performance improvements have been made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full list of changes can be found on &lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;our changelog page&lt;/a&gt; as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now head on over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt;, and go forth test some more! If all goes well, you can expect the release within a week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on map compatibility: already with the first playtest a new map format was introduced which is not backward-compatible with last October’s release-20141029. This means that if you have downloaded custom maps from &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;the Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere, these maps will have been automatically updated to the new map format once you have run this or one of the previous playtests.

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150405-ra-random-lobby.png" alt="Random factions - Lobby" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The faction of players who selected a random faction in the lobby…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150405-ra-random-ingame.png" alt="Random factions - In-game" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…will no longer be revealed to enemies in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150405-d2k-blendmodes.png" alt="Dune 2000 eye candy" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The visual effects for explosions and missile trails have been improved for the Dune 2000 mod.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The next release is drawing closer as we enter the feature freeze phase of the development cycle with this new playtest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can help our efforts to create a stable and balanced release by testing and &lt;a href="http://bugs.openra.net"&gt;reporting bugs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/community/"&gt;giving feedback&lt;/a&gt; on our various social media sites and forums, or simply in the comments section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last playtest, we have continued our focus on the Dune 2000 mod, which has received a brand new sidebar. The sandworms feature has been polished, and harvester insurance has been added, so if you lose your only harvester to a sandworm, it will be replaced automatically, for free!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those players that mourned the loss of the left-click orders option will be glad to hear that is has returned, better than ever. A new contributor took it upon himself to re-implement it in a way that avoided the numerous problems the earlier implementation had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In sell mode, a structure’s tooltip will show the expected refund value.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spy planes in Red Alert will no longer lure your anti-air capable units across the map.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airplanes will now fly higher and not push helicopters out of their way anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Harvester logic has been improved to make use of all available refineries and to avoid blockages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New missions: Allies03b and Allies05a for Red Alert, and GDI05a, Nod02a and Nod02b for Tiberian Dawn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More memory usage and performance improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Linux, the &lt;code&gt;.orarep&lt;/code&gt; file extension will be associated with OpenRA so that replays can be started from a file manager with a simple double-click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://changelog.openra.net"&gt;The changelog&lt;/a&gt; has the full list of fixes, changes and new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to our &lt;a href="/download/"&gt;download section&lt;/a&gt; to find the playtest installers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A note on map compatibility: already with the last playtest a new map format was introduced which is not backward-compatible with last October’s release-20141029. This means that if you have downloaded custom maps from &lt;a href="http://resource.openra.net"&gt;the Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere, these maps will have been automatically updated to the new map format once you have run this or the previous playtest. If you later go back to the release version, it will not be able to parse the new map format and crash. You can avoid the problem by either deleting the contents of your &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; folder, or by making backups of the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; folder and restoring that when you switch back to release-20141029. We should have mentioned that in the news post for the last playtest already, and apologize for any inconvenience that omission caused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150329-ra-randomcountries-dropdown.png" alt="Random Countries" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It is now possible to select a random country from among each side in Red Alert, Allies or Soviets.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150329-cnc-refund-tooltip.png" alt="Refund value in tooltip" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Tooltips now show the refund value when sell mode is activated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/news/20150329-ts-snow-preview.png" alt="Tiberian Sun Snow Preview" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, the work on the Tiberian Sun mod reached another milestone&lt;br /&gt;by completing support for the original game’s tilesets.&lt;/p&gt;
