    &lt;p&gt;Just in time for the holiday season, we are releasing &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;Playtest 20221223&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/e5fda938ada5be95883b9631e2dd1a3609fead45&quot;&gt;several important fixes and minor features&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added macOS universal binaries for Apple Silicon&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dropped support for macOS 10.9 and 10.10&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Updated macOS packaging, linux and macOS dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several pathfinder-related crashes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed the victory condition in a few of the Red Alert missions&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed carryalls in rare cases destroying their cargo&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added caryalls to the Dune 2000 spectator economy statistics&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Added new maps to the Dune 2000 map pool&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Other minor fixes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We expect this will be our final playtest before a full release, so we highly encourage everybody to play some games and missions and let us know if you find any issues in the comments below, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net&quot;&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.openra.net&quot;&gt;Community Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20221203/&quot;&gt;original playtest-20221203 announcement&lt;/a&gt; is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back, Commanders! After more than a year and a half the OpenRA team proudly presents &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;Playtest 20221203&lt;/a&gt;. It is finally here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been tons of massive changes under the hood, and with reduced contributor activity it took us a very long time to catch and squash all those pesky bugs. With the help of our third party mods and people testing the devtest builds we believe we have finally got a stable release on our hands. We are incredibly excited to showcase a number of new features and improvements that have been built up over the last year and a half:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One highlight feature is the new hierarchical pathfinder, which massively increases performance on large or more complex maps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-hpf.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 800px&quot; alt=&quot;HPF helps units better predict obstacles ahead of them&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;HPF helps units to better predict obstacles ahead of them.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our new netcode brings major improvements to multiplayer. Your games should feel much smoother and units more responsive in both low and high latency settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video width=&quot;800&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-td.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-td.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have added transient text notifications matching speech notifications. Now you can play without sound!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video width=&quot;800&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-transient.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fairly recent Dune film has brought many players to Dune 2000 and a decently sized multiplayer community was born. With the feedback from the community Dune 2000 has received a number of balance and polish changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video width=&quot;800&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-dune.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiberian Sun was not forgotten either. Although still not ready for a release, it has also received its fair share of features and bug fixes. This time around the highlight is tilting on slopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video width=&quot;800&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-slope.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20221203-slope.png&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;OpenRA now supports tilting on slopes!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the more visible new features and improvements include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures against sound / notification overlap. No more u-u-u-u-unit lost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measures against spamming the multiplayer lobby and in-game chat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ability to mute players&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for disabling the chat in replays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An ingame encyclopedia in Dune 2000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New Red Alert missions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community balance changes for all mods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable changes for mappers and modders include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatic map reloading in the background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A change to the way speed is calculated for ground units&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new map format which includes the map preview (minimap) in the map versioning (map hash)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loaders for more audio formats (e.g., mp3 and ogg), and formats used by the remasters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many linting and documentation updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as some other changes worth mentioning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toolchain and changes to support the .NET 6 runtime&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A massive amount of upgrades to both ingame and client UI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many more hotkeys became rebindable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Substantial progress towards localisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, 615 pull requests were merged since last release and 552 issues were closed bringing the total number of open tickets down by 141.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post covered just a small subset of all the changes and improvements added since the last release. We encourage anybody interested in finding out more to read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/907eabad94fef9233e5a376241ad0f06269eda83&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;We had originally planned to announce this release with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJbJ_UtmkDaL4cClS2QYd3uXueES4KEq&quot;&gt;patch spotlight&lt;/a&gt; video, but an unfortunately timed computer failure has left FiveAces’ battlefield control offline until repairs are completed. Rather than continue to delay the release, we have commissioned our best artist to make the placeholder image below, and will post the real spotlight once it is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20210321-spotlight-soon.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;Release spotlight placeholder&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The 20210321 release spotlight has been temporarily delayed. Stay tuned for updates!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the biggest changes in this release were focused around the in-development Tiberian Sun mod, which continues to make slow progress in our development repository. There are many great changes for Red Alert, Tiberian Dawn, and Dune 2000 too, focusing mainly around streamlining some awkward gameplay mechanics, improving community integration, and improving our singleplayer content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for Discord integration and community-run ladders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New lobby features for player handicaps and disabling spawn points&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Community balance updates and a refreshed map selection for Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Further adjustments to make Dune 2000 more faithful to the original game&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More fluid infantry combat after fixing several long-standing combat bugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nine more campaign missions have been ported for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved AI behaviour and performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features and more will be explained in more detail in the upcoming release spotlight, but for now you can look back over the previous news posts [&lt;a href=&quot;/news/devblog-20200629/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20201213/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20210131/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/79cc9e906649e1043e24e1f77a275e3b689d0d44&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important compatibility note is that OpenRA now requires GPU support for either OpenGL 3.2, DirectX 11, or OpenGL ES 3. Moving away from the legacy OpenGL 2.1 is important for future compatibility with modern rendering APIs (Vulkan/Metal) and for improving rendering performance with Tiberian Sun and the C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection. This does unfortunately mean dropping support for some older systems (typically 10+ years old) that currently can run OpenRA, but we believe that this is a necessary tradeoff for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20210321-website.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;New OpenRA website&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The new OpenRA website brings a new look and improved functionality.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also today deploying a brand new website design. Lead by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Fauntleroy&quot;&gt;@Fauntleroy&lt;/a&gt; with feedback from our GitHub and Discord communities, the fresh look also brings some important technology upgrades that improve the website behaviour on mobile devices, and adds new features for the &lt;a href=&quot;/games&quot;&gt;live games list&lt;/a&gt;. We expect to continue improving and iterating on the new site, so let us know if you think that something important is missing or simply doesn’t look right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us know what you think of the new release and updated website in the comments below, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net&quot;&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.openra.net&quot;&gt;community discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;Following a great run of testing over the holiday period, we are today releasing a new playtest build to fix reported issues and add some last-minute features.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Notable changes in &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;playtest-20210131&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new Handicap option to adjust the difficulty for individual players in Skirmish and Multiplayer&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new “Pause Menu Background” option in the display settings&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;One more mission (“Shock Therapy” from the Aftermath) for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new “Oil Spill” minigame map for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Additional community balance refinements for Tiberian Dawn&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A collection of audio and explosion changes to match the original games&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for downstream Linux packaging&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixes for bugs and crashes reported in playtest-20201213&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20210131&quot;&gt;Mod SDK Release&lt;/a&gt; for community mods&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For more information, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/c3df4d181331b89866b1f86d8217b4028a4361ae&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We expect this will be our final test before a full release in February, so we encourage everybody to play some games and let us know if you find any issues in the comments below, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net&quot;&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.openra.net&quot;&gt;Community Discord&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20201213/&quot;&gt;original playtest-20201213 announcement&lt;/a&gt; is included below:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Happy holidays from the OpenRA community!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just in time for the holiday period, we are kicking off a new playtest series for the next OpenRA release. Recent development has focused on building the foundation for future features, including a lot of work towards the Tiberian Sun mod which we described in our &lt;a href=&quot;/news/devblog-20200629/&quot;&gt;last news post&lt;/a&gt;. But this does not mean that this release is short on new features!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the new changes to look out for in &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;playtest-20201213&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New lobby options for Stealth Deliveries in Tiberian Dawn and Automatic Concrete in Dune 2000&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disable spawn points in a game lobby by right-clicking on the map preview&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share OpenRA status and game invites on Discord&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More fluid infantry combat after fixing several long-standing combat bugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Battlefield zooming is now centered on the mouse cursor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red Alert Spies can now reset support powers by infiltrating the structure that grants them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Servers can be configured to save replays, enabling the creation of community ladders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn include an updated set of skirmish/multiplayer maps, and community balance changes refresh their multiplayer meta. Dune 2000 features new weapon damage calculations that are more faithful to the original game, plus a number of other small consistency fixes. For single-player fans, Red Alert includes 8 more missions from the original game, and the AI behavior and performance has been improved across the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20201213-discord.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;Players who use Discord can now share their status and post game invites&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Players who use Discord can now share their status and post game invites in their favorite channels.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another topic from our &lt;a href=&quot;/news/devblog-20200629/&quot;&gt;previous development update&lt;/a&gt; was the announcement that we plan to support the C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection game assets in OpenRA’s Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn mods. The initial prototyping for this feature has been completed, and we are now working to integrate the required changes into the game engine for a future release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting these new assets will require optimizations that are not compatible with our legacy OpenGL 2.1 support, which is now disabled by default. On Windows, OpenRA will now use DirectX 11 (via the ANGLE library) for rendering. Please let us know if you encounter any unexpected graphical or performance issues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;An early sneak-preview of OpenRA with the C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection game assets.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technical focus for this release has been making preparations to migrate OpenRA to the modern cross-platform .NET (previously .NET Core) runtime. This release still uses the legacy .NET Framework and Mono, but makes significant changes behind the scenes which may require server hosts and package maintainers to adapt their build and run scripts. We anticipate that the next major OpenRA release will require .NET 5 (preferred) or Mono &amp;gt;= 6.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main macOS release now requires 10.13 or newer, but we plan to keep supporting players on 10.9 – 10.12 using a new “compat” release that can be downloaded from our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/releases&quot;&gt;GitHub Release Milestones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post has covered just a small subset of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/d207b07fe1713e2dedf547dbb09e03d120cffe9b&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;, and we encourage anybody interested in finding out more to read the full list. Head on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to install the new playtest, and let us know what you think in the comments below, on &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net/&quot;&gt;our forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/UcUztfr&quot;&gt;community Discord server&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that playtests install alongside the OpenRA release version, and you can automatically switch between the two versions when joining a multiplayer server, so there is no reason not to give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Chote</name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Playtest 20201213</title><link href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20201213/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Playtest 20201213" /><published>2020-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20201213</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20201213/">&lt;figure&gt;

In this post I would like to give a few comments on this topic, and show off some updates on OpenRA’s work-in-progress version of Tiberian Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Jim Vessella (the producer for C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection) reached out to the OpenRA team, we were proud to co-share (together with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/9nbrfm/cc_update_from_ea/&quot;&gt;r/commandandconquer subreddit&lt;/a&gt;) the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/special-announcement/&quot;&gt;first public announcement&lt;/a&gt; of what would become the Remastered Collection. OpenRA community members were also invited into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/news/remaster-update-community-council&quot;&gt;C&amp;amp;C Community Council&lt;/a&gt;, where we had close contact with the development team and provided a sounding board for development and design ideas while being able to advocate for the wishes of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim and the teams at Petroglyph and EA have done a fantastic job with the C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection, and the degree of transparency and openness they demonstrated with the community sets a new standard that we hope will lead other companies to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean for OpenRA? OpenRA and the Remastered Collection follow different philosophies about how to bring the classic C&amp;amp;C games into the 2020s. The Remastered Collection, as its name implies, upgrades the original game titles with higher fidelity assets and UI improvements while prioritising authenticity to the original gameplay experience. OpenRA’s goal is to envision what these games may instead have been were they developed again now - with features such as Attack Move, multiplayer-focused balance, and extensive modding capabilities designed into the core of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that both approaches can coexist, and intend for OpenRA to continue following the same philosophies that have guided it so far. &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?p=309029#p309029&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/9x1zcz/cc_remastered_announcement_from_ea/e9ozqrs/&quot;&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/gswgbw/amaa_were_the_team_behind_the_command_conquer/fs7ycc7/&quot;&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt; suggest that they are also ok with the current situation, and have no plans to interfere with OpenRA in any negative way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200629-civilians.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Red Alert civilians&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The full range of Red Alert civilians will be available in the next OpenRA release thanks to details learned from the C&amp;amp;C Remastered Collection source code release.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the surprise announcements for the Remastered Collection was that the dll files containing gameplay logic (a slightly modified version of the classic game engine) would be open sourced to enable mods, and that it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/news/remaster-update-modding&quot;&gt;released under the GPLv3&lt;/a&gt; to ensure license compatibility with OpenRA and other community projects. We are extremely grateful to Jim and the team for making this happen, and proud to have played a part in this RTS milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenRA’s game engine has been developed from scratch over many years using different programming languages and principles to the original C&amp;amp;Cs. This means that we cannot directly copy the source code, but will use it instead as a reference to learn what made the original games tick and to translate concepts and implementation details across where appropriate to improve OpenRA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next OpenRA release will contain some initial small fixes based on what we have already learned. One example of this is the original palette remap tables that the original Red Alert used to create the different civilian infantry types that were previously missing from OpenRA’s version. There is a lot more to learn, and we expect that this knowledge will influence and inspire many details in the evolution and growth of OpenRA over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular question has been whether OpenRA will support the remastered game assets, and I can now confirm (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/18239#issuecomment-646380281&quot;&gt;this GitHub comment&lt;/a&gt; for details) that we will work towards this goal. This will take time, as there are a number of technical challenges that must first be solved. We will provide more information on these plans in future posts, or you can follow progress directly on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200629-selection.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Tiberian Sun selection boxes&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Structures in Tiberian Sun now use the correct isometric-style selection boxes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, work has continued on OpenRA’s version of Tiberian Sun. Visible progress has been slow over the last couple of years while we focused on rebuilding parts of the low-level game engine to add the flexibility required to support the “gen2” games (Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2, and community mods based on them), without breaking support for “gen1” games (Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Dune 2000 and existing community mods). This work is now starting to pay off, as we are able to leverage the added flexibility to enable some long-awaited features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these are the isometric selection boxes used by structures. This may sound like a simple cosmetic change, but behind the scenes many changes were required to replace code designed for simple rectangular regions to understand more complicated shapes (i.e. the irregular hexagons used by buildings). The engine-level changes for this were actually made back in &lt;a href=&quot;/news/release-20180218/&quot;&gt;release-20180218&lt;/a&gt;, but we have only recently had time to adapt the gameplay code to use it. OpenRA’s isometric selection boxes have some visual tweaks compared to the original game to better integrate with our dynamic zooming and progress bars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major change in Tiberian Sun was its use of variable terrain heights, with vehicles that would visibly drive up and down slopes, and aircraft that would pitch and bank while flying. OpenRA’s support for these features has improved significantly in recent months, and is now complete enough to enable the aircraft flight dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video autoplay=&quot;&quot; loop=&quot;&quot; muted=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;/images/news/20200629-banshees.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Tiberian Sun aircraft can finally pitch and bank while flying.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most memorable aspects of Tiberian Sun was its ambience, which was largely created by its lighting effects. Work is almost complete on adding this to the OpenRA engine, with improvements to smooth out harsh steps and apply lighting tints to units making the feature even more immersive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200629-lighting.png&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Tiberian Sun lighting effects&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Tiberian Sun's dynamic lighting effects will soon be completed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work is also progressing on a number of gameplay features, with improvements to tunnels, building upgrades, TS-specific AI features, and the drop pods support power merged in recent weeks. We have made significant progress in 2020, but there is still a lot more work to finish before we can support a public release. OpenRA is developed by volunteers in their free time, so we cannot predict how long this may take.&lt;/p&gt;

Two months of public playtesting have allowed us to polish these changes into the release today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new release adds some long-awaited UI improvements, core engine upgrades, and a few balance changes for the multiplayer community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like videos, the main changes have been outlined in previous news posts [&lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200303/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200329/&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200418/&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200426/&quot;&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;], and, as always, in the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/61b8f4fd0ee62ef2e82120e3b52480a431ae7f83&quot;&gt;full changelog&lt;/a&gt;. A new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20200503&quot;&gt;Mod SDK&lt;/a&gt; release is also available, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://resource.openra.net/&quot;&gt;Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; now accepts maps designed for the new release.&lt;/p&gt;

Two months of public playtesting have allowed us to polish these changes into the release today.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Playtest 20200426</title><link href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20200426/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Playtest 20200426" /><published>2020-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20200426</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20200426/">&lt;div style=&quot;border-radius: 4px; background-color: #272d2c; padding: 5px&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Another weekend, another playtest! To help a small number of players who are experiencing problems with poor GPU drivers, we are today releasing &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;playtest-20200426&lt;/a&gt; which restores the ability to use OpenGL 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;OpenRA will continue to prefer OpenGL 3.2+ (or OpenGL ES 3.0+), but a new option in the settings menu allows you to switch back to the legacy rendering API if you experience glitches or performance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200426-glprofile.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;OpenGL Profile setting.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A new &quot;OpenGL Profile&quot; setting allows legacy OpenGL 2.1 rendering to be used.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This playtest also includes a scripting fix for two RA campaign missions, but no other gameplay changes. We believe that all of the important issues have now been resolved, so plan a final release in the near future if no issues are reported with the updated graphics support.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information, see the previous news posts for &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200418/&quot;&gt;playtest-20200418&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200329/&quot;&gt;playtest-20200329&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/playtest-20200303/&quot;&gt;original playtest-20200303 announcement&lt;/a&gt; post included below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent &lt;a href=&quot;/news/release-20200202/&quot;&gt;hotfix release&lt;/a&gt; addressing the worst bugs on the stable branch, we have been able to focus on completing work for the next big release.
We have taken a step back from gameplay this time around, focusing instead on core engine logic and improved UI features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;Playtest 20200303&lt;/a&gt; is now available, with a overhauled renderer that adds several long-awaited features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Smooth Zooming:&lt;/span&gt; The previous “pixel doubling” feature has been updated with the ability to smoothly zoom the battlefield using the mouse wheel or new hotkeys (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;). The default zoom level can be changed using the new Battlefield Camera option in the settings menu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;UI size options:&lt;/span&gt; Players with larger screen resolutions can increase the size of the menus, sidebar, and other UI elements using the new UI Scale option in the settings menu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Improved HiDPI support:&lt;/span&gt; OpenRA can now detect HiDPI rendering modes on Windows and Linux, fixing the blurry rendering for players on Windows with higher resolution screens. Many UI elements now include high resolution artwork, staying crisp when drawn at larger sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;New introduction screen:&lt;/span&gt; A new screen is displayed when launching the game for the first time to introduce the most important display and control options.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Overhauled settings menu:&lt;/span&gt; The Display and Input settings panels have been refreshed with new options and a new layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We note that &lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;OpenGL 3.2 or OpenGL ES 3 are now required&lt;/span&gt;. Moving away from OpenGL 2 is important for future compatibility with modern rendering APIs (Vulkan/Metal). This does unfortunately mean dropping support for some older systems (typically 10+ years old) that currently can run OpenRA, but we believe that this is a necessary tradeoff for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200303-introduction.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;The new first-run introduction dialog.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The new introduction screen shows the most important control and display options.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes in playtest-20200303 include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Updated production rallypoints:&lt;/span&gt; Rally points can now be queued (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Shift + Click&lt;/span&gt;) to define more complicated paths, and are now hidden until explicitly set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;New hotkeys:&lt;/span&gt; Shortcuts have been added to select and cycle harvesters (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;) and the production structure associated with the sidebar (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;New spectator Army tab:&lt;/span&gt; A new spectator view provides another way to compare player strength.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Notarized macOS releases:&lt;/span&gt; OpenRA is no longer blocked by the Gatekeeper on recent macOS versions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Improved pathfinding logic:&lt;/span&gt; Units are now smarter about moving when their original path is blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Map editor improvements:&lt;/span&gt; Undo/Redo is now supported, and improvements have been made to Copy/Paste and the actor property editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200303-rallypoint.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Rally point changes.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Production rally points can now define queued paths.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/20200303-specarmy.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 600px&quot; alt=&quot;The spectator army tab in Red Alert.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The spectator Army tab provides an overview of each player's forces.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playtest also includes a collection of modder-focused changes, and marks further progress towards the work-in-progress Tiberian Sun mod with fixes for low-level rendering bugs and new logic for production exits, EMP vs Aircraft, and the Firestorm Generator.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Just in time for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=85&amp;amp;t=21137&quot;&gt;upcoming RAGL Season 9&lt;/a&gt;, we are today releasing &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;playtest-20200418&lt;/a&gt; with several &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/6ed1ddcaf8ef2f9fbe47ae500f7effa9f8c3efda&quot;&gt;important fixes and polish changes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed a desync crash caused by Minelayers&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several issues related to Service Depots&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed issues with lobby player colour and faction validation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Restored country display for anonymous players in server lobbies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed several issues in the singleplayer campaign&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;With the recent surge in online player numbers, we want to make sure that the upcoming release is as stable as it can possibly be, so we encourage everybody to play some games on this new playtest and let us know if you find any serious bugs or notice anything else amiss!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;In other community news, the Fractured Realms team have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNoPFWkrvng&quot;&gt;released a trailer&lt;/a&gt; for their OpenRA-based game. A preview release should soon be available to download from their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moddb.com/mods/fractured-realms&quot;&gt;ModDB page&lt;/a&gt; if you like the look of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Today’s playtest addresses the issues discovered in the previous playtest, and hopefully constitutes our last release candidate for this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/194f0089b2b1c0a6f9a2fe882a0412c878873392&quot;&gt;changes in playtest-20200329&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The return of the ability to use right-click orders and scrolling at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A fix for aircraft not taking off when no rallypoint is set&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Further pathfinding improvements for infantry&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Adaptations to the weather overlay for smooth scrolling&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Reworked airstrip exits in Tiberian Dawn to prevent traffic jams&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fixed spicebloom behaviour in Dune 2000&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Two additional campaign missions for Tiberian Dawn and one more mission for Dune 2000&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Community balance changes for Red Alert&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As usual, this playtest also comes with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/releases/tag/20200329&quot;&gt;ModSDK release&lt;/a&gt; for our modding community.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We plan to release our next stable version within the next three weeks, so this will be the last chance to report any remaining issues that should be fixed. Head on over to our &lt;a href=&quot;/download&quot;&gt;download page&lt;/a&gt; to give the new playtest a try!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;New hotkeys:&lt;/span&gt; Shortcuts have been added to select and cycle harvesters (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;) and the production structure associated with the sidebar (&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Tab&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;New spectator Army tab:&lt;/span&gt; A new spectator view provides another way to compare player strength.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Notarized macOS releases:&lt;/span&gt; OpenRA is no longer blocked by the Gatekeeper on recent macOS versions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Improved pathfinding logic:&lt;/span&gt; Units are now smarter about moving when their original path is blocked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;about-highlight&quot;&gt;Map editor improvements:&lt;/span&gt; Undo/Redo is now supported, and improvements have been made to Copy/Paste and the actor property editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The spectator Army tab provides an overview of each player's forces.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The playtest also includes a collection of modder-focused changes, and marks further progress towards the work-in-progress Tiberian Sun mod with fixes for low-level rendering bugs and new logic for production exits, EMP vs Aircraft, and the Firestorm Generator.&lt;/p&gt;
